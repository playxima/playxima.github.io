It is recommended not to incorporate it at the beginning; typically, once it is introduced, it could be said that the mid-game phase has begun, where all conditions are set to ensure a quick and safe ascent. Moreover, it is a highly defensive block since it is the only one that can restrict the movement of other specials through opposition. Additionally, it is the only block that can be rescued back into the game once captured. It could be said that the special block is the heart of the strategy.</p><p>In many cases, it is advantageous to dominate the special block without capturing it until the appropriate moment, as its reintroduction from outside the board in the mid-game or endgame phase can be very perilous.</p><h3>The opposition of the special</h3><p>A special block cannot move or even pass over another special block, as they are not allowed to coexist in the same column under any circumstances.</p><p>In XIMA, &quot;opposition&quot; refers to the condition where two special blocks are adjacent to each other, separated only by the line or vertex that divides the squares. This situation becomes crucial, particularly during the endgame.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="23.png" alt="Figura XIMA 19"><img loading="lazy" src="24.png" alt="Figura XIMA 19"></figure><p>In the position shown in the diagram below, with it being the blue player&#x27;s turn, if they move their common block to G6 to assist their special block, the red special block could dominate the common block on G6 and snatch victory. On the other hand, if the common block moves to H8, the red special block cannot dominate it because it cannot pass over the blue special block. This last move highlights the opposition between the special blocks, ensuring victory for the blue player.</p><h3>The rescue of the especial</h3><p>Only the special block is allowed to reach the top floor or the square (G7); this does not mean that a common block cannot pass over this important square to make a specific move. If your team&#x27;s special block is captured during the game, then and only then can the affected player move one of their common blocks to the top of the board (G7) and exchange it with the opponent for their special block, which they can reintroduce into the game at their convenience. Of course, the common block must be immediately removed from square (G7).</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-blocking"><h2>The blocking</h2><p>Blocking: It is a structure of blocks that prevents the ascent or descent of other blocks located on different floors or levels. There are different types of blocking:</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="25.png" alt="Figura XIMA 20"></figure><p>Upper: This occurs when the structure of blocks that prevents is located above the block attempting to ascend. For example, in this case, the red special block intends to climb to the 3rd floor at square H6, but the blue block impedes its path.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="26.png" alt="Figura XIMA 21"></figure><p>Lower: This occurs when the structure of blocks that prevents passage is located below the block attempting to descend. For example, in this case, if the blue block at H5 were to attempt to dominate the red special block, it would not succeed because the red block at H3, which dominates the blue block, does not allow it. Once it descends to square H4, it loses all its height.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-obstruction"><h2>The obstruction</h2><p>Obstruction: It is a structure of blocks that prevents the movement of another block located on the same floor of the pyramid, regardless of its level.</p><p>There are different types of obstruction:</p><p>a. Total: This occurs when the obstructed block, in this case the block at E3, has no immediate possibility or hope of reaching square I3 in less than 3 moves, as it would need to go around the entire board to achieve this.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="28.png" alt="Figura XIMA 22"></figure><p>b. Partial: This occurs when the obstructed block can achieve its goal through a different route, though it would require using more moves.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="29.png" alt="Figura XIMA 23"></figure><p>In both cases of blocking and obstruction, the impediment can be internal or external:</p><p>Internal: When the block that obstructs the passage is located in the inner ring. External: When the block that obstructs the passage is located in the outer ring.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="value-of-the-blocks-and-the-board"><h2>Value of the blocks and the board</h2><p>In XIMA, everything has a value, from the blocks to the board itself, which accounts for its profound analysis. The board has a unique and unchangeable value, called the absolute value, determined by the direct position of the blocks on it. However, not all blocks are always directly on the board; they may occupy positions in the three-dimensional space over other blocks, elevating their positional level and continuously modifying the relief. This is referred to as relative value, as these spatial positions change in value depending on the structures formed.</p><p>Additionally, blocks, whether on the board or waiting outside to be incorporated, possess a unique and absolute real value, which varies depending on material scarcity or the functions they perform on the board. This constant change also gives them a relative value. All these factors make it practically impossible to determine the true value of a specific block or position in three-dimensional space. Therefore, understanding absolute value in a game is crucial for achieving victory.</p><h3>Absolute Value of the Blocks</h3><p>All blocks in XIMA are equal and have the same absolute value of one point when they are outside the board. Unlike common blocks, the special block always has double the value wherever it is located. This is because, in addition to having the same dynamic movement possibilities, it has the responsibility to reach the Top, its opposition capability, and the possibility of being rescued.</p><p>Once incorporated into the game, blocks are valued based on the floor they are supported on, even when dominating other blocks. To determine their value, one simply observes which floor these dominated blocks are supported on. For example:</p><ul><li>Blocks directly supported or supported on other blocks located on the first floor are valued at 2 points.</li><li>On the second floor, blocks are valued at 4 points.</li><li>On the third floor, blocks are valued at 6 points.</li><li>On the fourth floor, blocks are valued at 8 points.</li><li>For the special block, its value is considered infinite on the fourth floor.</li></ul><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="30.png" alt="Figura XIMA 24"></figure><h3>Relative value of the blocks</h3><p>Another value that must be considered is when one block dominates another(s). The dominant block acquires half the value of all the dominated block(s). For example, if a block dominates another on the first floor, the dominant block gains a total value of 3 points because its dynamic potential increases from that position, while 1 point is subtracted from the value of the dominated block because its mobility is limited. However, its value does not disappear entirely, as it still serves functions, such as preventing the dominant block from leaving that position and slightly limiting its movement decisions, as it would eventually release it.</p><p>As shown in the following example, on the third floor, for the blocks to the left of the top, the dominant block acquires a total value of 9 points, while the dominated block retains 3 points. In the case of the blocks to the right, notice how the special block acquires 6 points—half the value of each block it dominates—plus 12 points for being supported on blocks from the third floor, totaling 18 points.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="31.png" alt="Figura XIMA 25"></figure><p>Capturing a block can be worth as many points as its current position or even more, depending on the functions it performs, the consequences it triggers, or the effort required to reach that position. To calculate this, assign a real value to each of these functions, such as incorporating, aligning, cardinal moves, semi-coordinating, dominating, capturing, obstructing, blocking, pinning, reserving, managing, doubling, diverting, simplifying, threatening, counterattacking, creating a ladder, dis-coordinating, isolating, freeing, grouping, synchronizing, recovering, sacrificing, occupying, pressuring, forcing, semi-blocking, timing moves, ascending, descending, etc. Then, approximate what might be going through your opponent&#x27;s mind and calculate whether a move is good or which one is the best and most profitable.</p><p>In the near future, these values might change, but for now, more experience and analysis are needed to refine them further. My goal is to open doors and inspire your imagination to explore, rearrange, and evaluate new ideas. Remember, nothing is absolute; you are the future, and it’s up to you to redefine these values.</p><h3>Absolute Value of the Board</h3><p>The board has three types of values: radial, positional, and spatial. To understand these values, it’s necessary to consider two different perspectives. One is a top-down view, where squares are valued radially and angularly with respect to square G7. This can be seen in the following image, which shows how these values repeat across eight identical triangular areas. These areas are considered important and are ranked in the following order: diagonals and centers, squares with greater dynamic potential for the blocks, squares offering future support for ascending to upper floors, and the inner and outer rings of each floor. Although this method of evaluation is not the most critical, as it does not reveal much, it is necessary for those who wish to study the subject in greater depth. However, it is essential to note that diagonals, while offering the fastest routes for ascent, are also the easiest to obstruct, potentially immobilizing several blocks and causing a loss of time if not defended correctly in the midgame.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="top-view-of-the-board"><h2>Top View of the Board</h2><p>These values can be mathematically integrated into the board to aid decision-making. The other perspective is a side view, where the importance lies in the height levels between floors and the rings near the central column of the pyramid. One detail worth noting is that blocks located below and attached to the inner edge of each floor, despite being closer to the center, are worth less because this is a disadvantageous position. Blocks in these areas typically favor the opponent, as they are the last to climb or generally never climb, serving only as stairs for others.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="32.png" alt="Side and Top view of the pyramid"><img loading="lazy" src="33.png" alt="Side and Top view of the pyramid"><figcaption>Side and Top view of the pyramid</figcaption></figure><p>A very simple and quick way to mathematically assess who has the advantage in a given position or who is winning the game could be as follows.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="34.png" alt="three-dimensional frontal view of the board"><figcaption>three-dimensional frontal view of the board</figcaption></figure><p>If we assess the first floor in general, we can see that both sides have the same amount of forces in similar squares, so it is valued as an equality for the first floor, so it is not recommended to take it into account for the second floor and thus simplify the problem.</p><p>While on the second floor, if we value the blue ones, we can calculate that they have a total of 10 points, (4) points for the block that is in row 10 and (6) points for the one that is dominating the red one in column C3, and if we assess the reds, we can see that on the second floor they also have a total of 10 points (4) points for the one that is in row 11 plus (4) points for the one that is in row 4 and (2) points for the block dominated in column C3. Coming to the conclusion that they are tied in terms of dynamic possibilities that the blocks may have on the board, but if you look closely, the blues reached the same total score as the reds with one block less, so it must have a block outside one more than the red ones, and if we had to know at this point in the game how much a block outside is worth, we will also see that it is very simple once we know the scoring system CIMAX.</p><p>But well, so that you do not remain in doubt with a few words I will explain to you that the way to know how much a block that is out of the game is worth is equal to the total sum of all the blocks in the game divided by the number of those same blocks that provided that sum. For example, in this case we are analyzing the total sum of the blue ones including the block of the first floor is 12 points divided by three blocks gives us a value of 4 points on average for all the blue blocks including those that are outside, (this is also known as playing force) and now if we can make a definitive comparison taking into account that no capture has been made.</p><p>Therefore, the blue blocks are winning the game with 12 points on the board + 7 blocks outside for 4 points on average would be 28 + 12 = 40 points in total compared to 12 of the reds on the board + 6 blocks outside for 3 points on average would be 18 + 12 = 30 points.</p><p>Although it may not seem so, there are so many possible combinations in the XIMA that from one move to another a slight mistake could be amplified so much that we could lose the game.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="scoring-system-called-cimax"><h2>Scoring System called CIMAX</h2><p>The CIMAX scoring system is a mathematical method, based on statistical calculation, to measure the level and relative skill of players in XIMA. This method is highly accurate because it does not solely consider whether a player wins or loses a match to draw conclusions. It also takes into account factors such as the strength of moves, power, level of play, time used in relation to the agreed time, and the number of turns taken. This provides a more realistic representation of the conditions under which the match was played.</p><p>This system ensures that the outcome of a match is judged directly and in real-time, without relying on an expected result based on the difference in level between players. It is fairer and more precise to draw conclusions from existing statistical data and then combine this result with the level difference to establish a ranking.</p><p>Below, we will present the formulas and their application for establishing the CIMAX ranking under any circumstances that may arise between players. It is important to note that the CIMAX points a player wins are subtracted from the CIMAX points of the player who loses. The system functions somewhat like cryptocurrency, where knowledge is gained or lost based on the experience of the participating players. When a new player joins, they are assigned 1000 CIMAX points to start.</p><p>In case you&#x27;re wondering how, even when a player loses in XIMA, they still gain experience and knowledge—don’t worry, the same happens to the winner. The only way to validate this is through the result of the next match.</p><p>Below is the formula used to calculate CIMAX, explained in the most user-friendly way possible. While we acknowledge that this content is dense, it is necessary and forms an integral part of XIMA’s creation and its innovative contributions.</p><div class="formula"><pre>\text{CIMAX}=\left( \text{Level of Play} \right)
    \left( \dfrac{\text{Maximum Game Power}+1}{\text{Minimum Game Power}+1} \right)
    \left( \dfrac{\text{Loser&#x27;s CIMAX}}{\text{Winner&#x27;s CIMAX}} \right)</pre></div><p>In other words: The new CIMAX is equal to the level of play multiplied by the result of the division between the player with the highest power plus one and the player with the lowest power plus one. This is then multiplied by the result of the division between the current CIMAX of the losing player and that of the winning player.</p><p>To calculate the CIMAX, the first thing you need to know is the level of play, which is simply the sum of the playing strengths of both players.</p><div class="formula"><pre>\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad \quad\quad \quad
  \quad \quad \quad \quad
 L_G= F_G(1)+F_G(2),</pre></div><p>where and are the game force of the first and second player respectively.</p><p>How to calculate game force was previously explained in order to understand the average value of the blocks so that you could get an idea of that specific position in a match that hadn’t finished yet. The truth is, it doesn’t differ much from what I will explain next, but now we will show you the complete formula, even for cases where the game ends, and when a player resigns or runs out of time.</p><div class="formula"><pre>\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad \quad\quad \quad
  \quad \quad 
F_G = V_{BB} + V_{OB} + V_{CB} + V_R+V_W,</pre></div><p>where:</p><ul><li>(Value of the blocks on the board): We explained how to calculate it in Sec. ( ).</li><li>(Value of the blocks off the board): Once the first block is incorporated, the value of each block off the board equals the average value of the blocks on the board.</li><li>(Value of the captured blocks): Before a block is captured, it always has a value in that position. When captured, it retains that last value, which is added as force points to the player who captured it.</li><li>(Resignation value): The player who resigns will give the opposing player half of their game force. If a player runs out of time, it is also considered a resignation.</li><li>(Win value): When the special block is positioned at the top, the game is automatically won, and a value of 16 XIMAs is added to the game force. Normally, a common block would generate 8 XIMAs, but remember that this one is special.</li></ul><p>Game power is directly proportional to game force and inversely proportional to the time on the clock and the number of turns used by the player. Having a higher game power increases the game force and raises the likelihood of victory, but does not guarantee it due to possible mistakes (&quot;bad moves&quot;) that the player with greater power might make, which led us to create the following formula:</p><div class="formula"><pre>\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad \quad\quad \quad
  \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad 
P_G = \frac{F_G}{2^{te} \cdot T},</pre></div><p>where:</p><ul><li>(Game Power)</li><li>(Effective time): The effective time is the ratio of the time the player used to the total agreed time. For example, if both players agree to 10 minutes each, this would be the agreed time, and the time used until the game ends is the employed time, which is usually different for each player. In formula form, it would look like this:</li><li>T (Turns used by the player in the game)</li></ul><p>Once we know that game power () is calculated by dividing a player’s game force () by the result of 2 raised to the effective time (), which is then multiplied by the number of turns (T) they used, we can calculate the new CIMAX earned or lost by a player.</p><p>In a XIMA match where the players have a CIMAX of and and develop a game power of and , assuming that Player 1 wins the match, the new CIMAX of both players will undergo a correction, with the winner absorbing certain points from the CIMAX of the loser as a reward for reaching the summit. This corrective term, which we will call (Delta), is proportional to the game force, game power, playing with little time on the clock, playing against opponents with a higher CIMAX, etc. The adjustment of their new CIMAX depending on whether they win or lose is given by the correction:</p><div class="formula"><pre>\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad 
\Delta=\alpha \times \beta \times L_G=\dfrac{C_X(loser)}{C_X(winner)}\frac{P_G(Max)+1}{P_G(Min)+1}(F_G(1)+F_G(2))</pre></div><p>In the case of a XIMA match with more than two players, a similar analysis can be made, leading to an extension of the CIMAX correction equation.</p><p>We know these formulas are complex, but we don’t have an easier way to show you the progress and revolution this entails. We only hope that XIMA players will become some of the most intelligent human beings in existence, and thus be able to understand its importance.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="threats-to-the-special"><h2>Threats to the special</h2><p>In the following case, the blue special block can be dominated by the red blocks. In this example, it is threatened by three blocks simultaneously: (E3, I6, I7). We will now show the different known possible ways to evade this threat:</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="35.png" alt="Figura XIMA 28"></figure><ul><li>Moving to a non-attacked place, either on the same level taking advantage of the board’s features, or to a higher or lower level. In this case, it could move to (J4, H2, or E7), escaping all threats.</li><li>Dominating with the special block a block of our own or an opponent’s, or even capturing the attacking block if applicable. For example, if we dominate with the special block any of these blocks (E3, I6, I7), we would solve the problem. However, if we dominate with the special block (H4 or K5), we can also protect it by dominating with the block at (I4) and moving it to (I3), where we would achieve a solution, though it would be less effective but still valid.</li><li>Blocking or obstructing the attacking blocks. For instance, if we dominate the block at I6 with the block at G6, we obstruct the block at I7, but not the block at E3.</li><p>Deflecting or recapturing could be another alternative. For example, if we move the block from I4 to H4, note how if our special block is dominated, we could capture that block.</p><li>Other temporary, more indirect alternatives would be to counter-attack the opponent’s special block to gain time. For example, if we move KJ4, and lastly, the most desperate solution would be to threaten the top with a common block, like LG6, to indicate that if the special block is captured, it could be immediately rescued and repositioned in a better place.</li></ul><p>José Raúl Capablanca, our World Chess Champion, is remembered as one of the greatest endgame players of all time. His mastery and precision in this phase of the game are universally recognized and constitute a source of study for anyone who aims to achieve a comprehensive understanding of this phase of the game. As you can see, his knowledge is not only universal but also perfectly applicable to other genres like XIMA.</p><p>Regarding endgame study, Capablanca says in his book &quot;Últimas Lecciones&quot; (written in 1942):</p><p>&quot;To study and practice Chess, it is advisable to divide the game into three parts: the opening, the middle game, and the endgame. These three parts are closely interconnected, and it would be a grave error to study the opening without considering the middle game and the endgame. Likewise, it would be an error to study the middle game without considering the endgame.</p><p>The above reasoning clearly demonstrates that to perfect oneself in XIMA, the endgame must be studied first, as the endgame can be studied and learned on its own, while the middle game and the opening should only be studied in relation to the endgame.</p><p>For this reason, we will develop the following content in that same order.</p></section>
