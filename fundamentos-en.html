          <section class="chapter" id="what-is-xima"><h2>What is XIMA?</h2><p>XIMA is the closest material representation of our complex and incredible way of thinking.</p><p>Human nature pushes us to aim for the top from the very beginning, even as sperm, where a tough competition starts to reach the ultimate goal: the start of life.</p><p>XIMA was created to teach people how to think and find happiness. It began with a promise of love—to make the best board game ever, bringing families together to share meaningful moments.</p><p>From the start, the goal was clear: to create something truly unique. This meant breaking away from flat, two-dimensional designs and adding a new dimension to board games. We were determined to achieve this, even if it meant challenging conventional ideas. Instead of copying existing game mechanics, we committed to building something entirely original.</p><p>Our ambition to create the most complete game in history required years of thought before we designed the first prototype. This wasn’t just another game—there were already plenty of those. XIMA had to stand out: unique, original, diverse, and strategically advanced. We set a bold goal: to surpass even classics like Chess and Go. After 12 years, XIMA became a reality.</p><p>XIMA combines a three-dimensional design with deep strategy and tactics. While it doesn’t defy gravity, the game uses it as a core element. We’ve even added a fourth dimension for professional players. Its hybrid style adapts to all kinds of players, making it the first of its kind. With a third degree of movement freedom, XIMA introduces players to a world of science and strategy. It has the highest known combinatorial complexity—1.7 billion possibilities by the second turn for two players. Yet, despite its depth, XIMA is easy to learn and always guarantees a winner.</p><p>Here are the unique features that set XIMA apart from other games:</p><ul><li>Three Dimensions: XIMA’s four-level, staggered 3D board allows movement across levels and in two dimensions. Professional games may even include teleportation for added strategic depth.</li><li>Unprecedented Combinations: By the second turn, XIMA offers over 1.7 billion possible moves and combinations, even with just two players. This doesn’t include teleportation or the variations with triangular, hexagonal, or circular boards.</li><li>Easy Learning Curve: Despite its complexity, XIMA is easy to learn. Within 5-10 minutes, players are ready to start. All blocks move in the same way, and only vertical movement between floors requires attention.</li><li>New Gameplay Concept: XIMA introduces a hybrid genre called Scienluck where players can choose to include chance (like dice games) or play purely strategically (like chess). This new concept balances the game for players of all skill levels.</li><li>Inclusive Play: XIMA allows more than two players at once, creating new ways to compete while staying true to its core objectives. It also encourages couples, teams, or mixed-gender play, fostering diversity.</li><li>Peaceful Objective: Unlike many games, XIMA promotes victory through building strategies rather than destruction. It goes beyond social barriers, focusing on personal growth and positive competition.</li><li>No Draws: Designed to avoid the draws common in chess or Go, XIMA always guarantees a winner by encouraging continuous material growth and evolving strategies.</li><li>Simplified Notation: XIMA uses an easy-to-understand notation system that makes it more accessible to study and analyze.</li><li>Accessibility: XIMA’s simple design makes it easy to produce and transport, with uniform cube blocks and foldable boards. This accessibility encourages its spread to economically challenged or remote areas.</li></ul><p>This book opens the door to a new universe. Although XIMA is new and original, we know there is still a long journey ahead. Its teaching methodology is just beginning, offering a path to potential greatness for those who help its tactical, technical, and strategic development.</p><p>Join us in this journey of learning and growth, where everyone can develop their skills through the knowledge and practice of XIMA.</p><h3>Characterization and values of XIMA</h3><p>XIMA, like other board games, represents a static space where dynamic pieces, or &quot;blocks,&quot; move, similar to how the material world changes over time.</p><p>In XIMA, the main goal is to reach the highest position on square G7. This makes positioning the most important part of the game. Players must plan the best strategies to reach this shared goal, often using the special block to move up.</p><p>XIMA is one of the few games in the world that can be played without depending on luck. Both players start equally, but the game can also include dice to make it more fun and accessible, perfect for family and friends. Because of this, XIMA doesn’t fit into traditional game types like &quot;Chance&quot; or &quot;Science&quot; but combines both.</p><p>This mix of strategy and flexibility makes XIMA part of a new genre—Scienluck, which combines science and chance.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-Scienluck-mode"><h2>The Scienluck Mode</h2><p>Scienluck mode was created to give all players a fair chance to win, regardless of their opponent&#x27;s skill, and to make losing less discouraging.</p><p>Scienluck is a mix between strategy (science) and luck. Players can either roll two dice on their turn and make two moves (one for each die), or they can make one safe and legal move with any of their blocks—this is called the &quot;science&quot; or &quot;skill&quot; mode.</p><p>To understand Scienluck, let&#x27;s first summarize the two main types of board games:</p><ul><li>Games of Chance: These games rely heavily on luck. Players don’t need much preparation because luck can change the outcome, no matter how predictable things seem.</li><li>Games of Skill: These are tactical, strategic games with no luck involved. Players win by using observation, preparation, and study. Both players start equally.</li><li>Scienluck Games: A hybrid of luck and skill, where both players have equal chances depending on their decisions. It&#x27;s semi-predictable but still requires strategy and tactics.</li></ul><p>When we developed Scienluck mode, we first studied how to modify the original game. We wanted to ensure both players—whether using luck (dice) or skill (no dice)—had equal chances. To balance things, we allowed the player using dice to make two moves if the dice added up to 12 (the highest sum), giving them access to any part of the board. This player could also move two different blocks with the dice results, such as using a 5 to bring in a block from outside and a 3 to move another block already on the board.</p><p>This system allows flexibility: the player can use one block to move in two different directions or use the dice separately. For example, they could move 3 steps in one direction and then 5 in another. But, of course, they must follow all the XIMA rules.</p><p>We believe this balance works well, though we are constantly improving the game. We&#x27;re also considering allowing dice results to be subtracted for additional movement options.</p><p>Scienluck reflects a philosophical balance between materialism and idealism, as it tests which side—luck or skill—ultimately prevails.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="Scienluck-solo-play"><h2>Scienluck Solo Play</h2><p>Scienluck also offers a great solo mode, where you can play against yourself. By choosing the &quot;science&quot; side, you can focus entirely on strategy, while the &quot;chance&quot; side adds unpredictability with the dice rolls. This keeps the game dynamic, as you never know the outcome.</p><p>For those who have played chess against themselves, you know how difficult it can be to win or lose since you already know your own plans. You end up calculating every move in depth, which can lead to mistakes. This is why we believe XIMA is excellent for solo play—it mirrors real life with its complex, ever-changing possibilities.</p><p>XIMA is a game that reflects the personality of each player. Through it, you learn much about yourself and others: whether you&#x27;re strategic, quick-thinking, honest, polite, or competitive. Most importantly, it helps you learn from your mistakes, growing as both a player and a person.</p><p>XIMA also improves decision-making in complex situations, teaching you to filter out unnecessary information and focus on what&#x27;s important. It strengthens logical thinking, imagination, attention, and concentration.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="origins-of-xima"><h2>Origins of XIMA</h2><p>XIMA was conceived in 2010 in Havana, Cuba, by Yosdel Vicente Muiño Acevedo and Dr. Liz Power Suarez. The idea emerged after writing a children&#x27;s story called The Pawn King.</p><p>The story is set in a magical chess world where the pieces come to life. A simple pawn dreams of marrying a beautiful lady. While writing, I avoided focusing too much on chess and let my imagination run free, wondering what it would be like to invent a completely new game.</p><p>This dream became so vivid that it felt real. Then, my son Ledsoy was born, named after the hero of the story, with his name being my own reversed. Later, my daughter Caissa was born, named after the muse of chess, though I didn’t know it at the time.</p><p>The reinvention of chess became so detailed in my mind that I felt ready to create something entirely new—a promise I made to my partner to invent the next great board game.</p><p>We decided that the new game should move upward, even if it meant defying gravity. The concept of the pyramid inspired us to begin developing the rules, and together, we created XIMA.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="rules-of-xima"><h2>Rules of XIMA</h2><p>Main Objective of the Game:</p><p>• Bring your special block to the top of the board before your opponents.</p><p>Basic Rules:</p><ol><li>At the start of the game, all blocks (10 in total) are outside the board.</li><li>Each player takes one turn and can either bring a new block onto the board or move an already placed block.</li><li>Blocks move in straight lines in any direction—vertical, horizontal, or diagonal—for as many steps as you like. If playing with chance, they move the number of steps shown by the dice.</li><li>When bringing a block onto the board, both the first and last steps must be on the board.</li><li>Once a block is on the board, it cannot move off the board.</li><li>Blocks can go up or down on their next move to any spot with the same height or lower than where they are.</li><li>Moving a block over another block stops its movement and eliminates any blocks beneath it that are a different color in the same column.</li><li>If a special block is captured, the player can bring a regular block to the top of the board to rescue the special block, which can be placed back on the board later.</li><li>A regular block can only go to the top to rescue the special block; otherwise, it can pass over square G7.</li><li>A player loses if they have no blocks left on or off the board when it&#x27;s their turn.</li><li>A player wins if they control all of their blocks on the board.</li><li>A player cannot repeat the same position or sequence of moves for three turns in a row.</li><li>If the game reaches a deadlock or draw, each player gets three extra blocks, known as a &quot;material increase,&quot; instead of ending in a draw.</li></ol><p>At first, the rules were much simpler; there were barely three. The first rule was about how to go up. I remember thinking, &quot;But how do you go up?&quot; At that point, there wasn&#x27;t even a physical board, just drawings on paper. Luckily, Liz was there to help me figure it out. Here&#x27;s a photo (Fig. ) showing my early experiments, using a pyramid made out of dice cups I had in a shoebox.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="1.jpg" alt="A pyramid made of dice cups to create a XIMA-prototype"><figcaption>A pyramid made of dice cups to create a XIMA-prototype</figcaption></figure><p>Then, we gave movement to the blocks. We decided to call the pieces &quot;blocks&quot; because pyramids are built from blocks, and we wanted to avoid confusion with the names used in other games.</p><p>For the movement, we first tested with Chess pieces before deciding on blocks. The game played very well, and even the knight could move up from one level to another without using a step, but it couldn&#x27;t win the game. This was good, but it wasn&#x27;t the solution we needed. At that time, we called the game &quot;Cima,&quot; in Spanish, which means top or summit, and it could be played with Chess-like pieces in cube form. This idea came from an earlier project I created at university called &quot;Hustle,&quot; which later led to &quot;360 degrees&quot;—the predecessor of XIMA. In &quot;360 degrees,&quot; players moved from the center of the board, controlling squares based on dice rolls. One die showed cardinal directions (north, south, east, west, and diagonals), and the other showed how many steps to move. This concept influenced the movement of the blocks in XIMA.</p><p>Of course, I knew the goal was to reach the top, but something was still missing in the gameplay. I was tempted to follow the trend of creating animated blocks to simulate war, aggression, and destruction. This would have been popular and profitable, but I had the courage to create a game with a noble, peaceful objective. The blocks would simply combine to reach the top and win, without destroying anything. This was our message to future generations.</p><p>In avoiding the temptation to follow certain design trends, we made sure XIMA still resembled traditional games, without losing its modern, original essence. If you notice similarities to games like Parcheesi, with its goal of reaching the center, or Checkers and Chinese Checkers with pieces jumping over others, that’s no accident. XIMA also uses a notation system like Chess, has blocks outside the board like the stones in Go, and incorporates many familiar elements. Everything was well thought out and calculated, guided by a dream and faith.</p><p>I won&#x27;t spend time on details about how it all came together, so let’s move on to learn more about XIMA. The depth I share with you is just the surface of this beautiful universe that is waiting to be discovered. Of course, we risk being wrong, so I encourage you to question everything and challenge any methodology or theory I present. This way, XIMA can evolve as quickly as possible.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-xima-board-levels-and-rings"><h2>The XIMA Board: Levels and Rings</h2><p>The XIMA board, or pyramid, has a stepped, three-dimensional shape with 4 levels. When viewed from the top, it has 13 rows of squares vertically and 13 rows of squares horizontally, for a total of 169 squares, alternating between light and dark colors (white and black). The pyramid is placed so that one face is directly in front of the players.</p><p>From a top-down view, here are the positions that players should occupy based on the number of participants. The shaded area in red represents one of the four pyramid faces: (A1-M1-G7); (M1-M13-G7); (M13-A13-G7); (A13-A1-G7).</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="2.png" alt="Top view of the XIMA board"><figcaption>Top view of the XIMA board</figcaption></figure><p>From a side view of the board, we can see that it has 4 levels, with the 4th being the highest and the most important since the first one to move their special block to this level will be the champion of the game.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="3.png" alt="Side view of the XIMA board"><figcaption>Side view of the XIMA board</figcaption></figure><p>Each level, except for the fourth, is composed of two rings: the inner ring indicated on the first level, which is the largest and colored orange, and the outer ring indicated in blue on the second level, which is the medium one.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="6.png" alt="Cut of the first, second, and third levels from a top view of the XIMA board."><figcaption>Cut of the first, second, and third levels from a top view of the XIMA board.</figcaption></figure><p>The area shaded in yellow is called a band and refers to two adjacent rows, in this case, vertical, that are on the same face on a given level. The squares A1, M1, M13, A13 are individually called outer corner squares, and the squares B2, L2, L12, B12 are called inner corner squares, similarly on each level. From a top view, if we draw an imaginary line from G1 to G13 and from A7 to M7, these squares together would be called central squares. The squares G1, M7, M13, A7 are individually called outer central squares, and the squares G2, L7, G12, B7 are called inner central squares, similarly on each level. From a top view, if we draw an imaginary line from A1 to M13 and from M1 to A13, these squares together would be called upper diagonals.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="7.png" alt="Figura XIMA 5"><img loading="lazy" src="8.png" alt="Figura XIMA 5"></figure><p>Each level has a height of two steps, and each step has the height of one block. The 4th level can also be referred to as G7 or Summit.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="position-and-movement-of-the-blocks"><h2>Position and movement of the blocks</h2><p>At the start of the game, the blocks are outside the board, each player has a total of 10, including one special block that will be responsible for reaching the summit or G7. All blocks move the same way and can pass through any square on the board but always in a straight line from their current position, whether vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or at 45 and 90-degree angles up and down relative to the support plane, in an unlimited number of steps or as indicated by the dice when playing in chance mode.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="9.png" alt="Figura XIMA 6"><img loading="lazy" src="10.png" alt="Figura XIMA 6"></figure><p>Its movement can only be stopped by a block structure or by the board&#x27;s own limitations. The player can introduce a new block on their turn or, if they prefer, move one that is already on the board. Once a block is on the board, it can never leave the game until the end of the match or until it is captured.</p><p>Technically, to introduce a new block onto the board, it must be done as follows: in a straight line forward on the face where it is to be introduced (from outside to inside), right diagonal, or left diagonal. Example:</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="11.png" alt="Figura XIMA 7"></figure><p>Important: when a block is introduced, it must do so onto the board; it cannot start or end its movement on top of another block, even of its own color. Otherwise, the game would not make sense, as the second player would move on top of the first player&#x27;s block each time a block is introduced. Blocks can ascend to any position on their next step as long as their ceilings are together and aligned. And they can descend to any position.</p><h3>Ways to climb up to a higher floor</h3><ol><li>a): Over one&#x27;s own block</li><li>b): Over an opponent&#x27;s block</li></ol><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="12.png" alt="Figura XIMA 8"><img loading="lazy" src="12.5.png" alt="Figura XIMA 8"></figure></section><section class="chapter" id="the-notation-system"><h2>The notation system</h2><p>The notation system used in XIMA originates from an adaptation of the system used in Chess, known as simplified algebraic notation. However, in XIMA, we call it very simplified algebraic notation. Since we have only one type of movement for the 10 blocks, unlike Chess, which uses 6 pieces with different movements, it is unnecessary in XIMA to specify the names of the blocks unless referring to the moment of incorporating the special block, which is denoted by an equal sign (=). Another difference is that in XIMA, the board uses uppercase letters to define rows and columns, as they do not interfere with the names of any blocks.</p><p>The very simplified algebraic notation system has two modes: the long or complete mode, which is easier for beginners to learn, and the short or abbreviated mode, which is more efficient for advanced players.</p><p>In the long mode, you simply write the name of the square from which the block starts, followed by the name of the square it reaches. This method is straightforward and ideal for beginners.</p><p>In the short mode, typically used by experienced players, only the square where the block arrives is mentioned, without specifying the starting square most of the time. This approach is less cumbersome to annotate and easy to understand once skills in XIMA are acquired.</p><p>Below, we provide examples of how to record moves in both modes for better understanding.</p><ol><li>a): Move number followed by a period.</li><li>b): Name of the destination square of the moving block. (In the long mode, the starting square is indicated followed by the destination square).</li><p>Note: If a new block is introduced onto the board, a hyphen or minus sign (-) must precede the move, and if it is the special block, an equal sign (=).</p></ol><p>Examples:</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="13.png" alt="Figura XIMA 9"></figure><p>Observe how there is NO need to put a minus sign (-) in move 4 for the Blue team or in move 5 for the Red team since they moved a block that was already on the board. The difference between both systems in terms of notation is also beginning to be noticeable.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="14.png" alt="Figura XIMA 10"></figure><p>Pay attention to how in move 7 for the Red team, there are two blocks that can move to the same square D11: one is the block from C10 and the other is from B13. Therefore, it is necessary to specify which of them is moving to the destination square, and the problem is solved. In this case, the vertical column B is highlighted without the need to mention 13, as there are no other blocks in this column that match. Unlike the long mode, where you always specify both the starting and destination squares for all moves.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="14.png" alt="Figura XIMA 11"></figure><p>In the case of move 9 for the Red team in the short mode, observe how there are two blocks that can also move to C7. If both belong to the same column, it is necessary to differentiate them somehow, and for this, the row number or horizontal position where they are located is used—in this case, (8) to indicate the starting square, followed by the destination square.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="16.png" alt="Figura XIMA 12"></figure><p>In move 11 for the Blue player, there are 2 possible captures with the same block in the same vertical column (c), so the row number (10) is indicated to differentiate where the capture will occur. For the Red player in move 11, something similar happens but with domination, as they can dominate several blocks in the same vertical column but with different blocks.</p><p>Therefore, the row number is highlighted first to define the starting square of the block that will dominate, followed by the row number where it will end up dominating—in this case, the column in row (10).</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="17.png" alt="Figura XIMA 13"></figure><p>Here, the special block is incorporated for the first time, and you can see how an equal sign (=) is used to differentiate it from the common blocks. Sometimes, as in move 21, it can be inferred that when it&#x27;s a single move, no equal sign (=) is placed. Similarly, when a common block and a special block coincide on the same square, if no equal sign (=) is used, it means the common block made the move, as in move 22 for the blue player.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="18.png" alt="Figura XIMA 14"></figure><p>If by chance there&#x27;s a move where several blocks coincide on the same destination square, and furthermore there are 2 or more blocks in the same column, and when defining by the row number there are also 2 or more blocks in this row, as in move 24 for the red player, then we resort to the long system in the short mode because there&#x27;s no other choice. The complete name of the starting square up to the destination square of the block that will move is written, and once again, the problem is solved.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="19.png" alt="Figura XIMA 15"></figure><p>The arrival at the summit can be symbolized by any of the following denominations: G7, XIMA, top, summit, 4th floor, (*), (x+), (1-0), 77, Win.</p><p>Important note: In case of playing with dice, the result or results of these are placed followed by the symbol (/) before writing the name of the starting square. For example:</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="20.png" alt="Figura XIMA 16"></figure><p>In Cimistic literature, as it could be called, we can also find these types of symbols and signs that can assess a specific move, just like in other games:</p><dl><dt>!!</dt><dd>Very good move</dd><dt>!</dt><dd>Good move</dd><dt>??</dt><dd>Very bad move</dd><dt>?</dt><dd>Bad move</dd><dt>!?</dt><dd>Interesting move</dd><dt>?!</dt><dd>Doubtful move</dd></dl><p>Other general symbols you should know:</p><dl><dt>R</dt><dd>Red block(s)</dd><dt>V</dt><dd>Green block(s)</dd><dt>Z</dt><dd>Blue block(s)</dd><dt>AM</dt><dd>Yellow block(s)</dd></dl><p>Special outcomes:</p><dl><dt>1-0</dt><dd>First player wins</dd><dt>0-1</dt><dd>First player loses</dd><dt>0-1-0-0</dt><dd>Second player wins, first, third, and fourth players lose (in case of more than two independent players).</dd><dt>0-1-0-1</dt><dd>Second player wins, first and third players lose; second and fourth players win (in case of team play).</dd></dl></section><section class="chapter" id="outcome-of-a-match"><h2>Outcome of a Match</h2><p>A game ends when:</p><ul><li>A player reaches the top with a special block in a legal manner.</li><li>An opponent voluntarily abandons the game.</li><li>The clock is used and the opponent exceeds the time limit for reflection.</li><li>All blocks belonging to a single player are captured.</li></ul><p>It is very common for players not to finish games, as one opponent may find it unnecessary to continue trying to stop the other from climbing to victory and will abandon the game at their convenience. It is considered unethical to keep playing from an inferior position against a recognized strong opponent, as the outcome is seen as inevitable.</p><p>However, in professional XIMA matches, where statistics such as strength and playing power are recorded, it is recommended to play until the end. A defeat does not define a player&#x27;s level of skill but instead demonstrates the determination to fight until the very last moment with dignity, which is ultimately the essence of life. Additionally, the audience always appreciates witnessing the game being played out to its conclusion.</p><h3>The drowned</h3><p>When a player cannot move any block on their turn, they are declared &quot;stalemate&quot; and lose the game. This rule is necessary to always give the opponent a chance to defend themselves. It is a gesture of honor and hope that is very important and can be useful in games with more than two participants.</p><h3>Without Resource</h3><p>When a player cannot perform any function in the game due to the lack of all their blocks, they will lose the game.</p><h3>Increasing of material or blocks</h3><p>As we all know, XIMA does not allow draws, so any situation that leads to this outcome will always resort to material increment for all players equally.</p><p>Material increment involves adding an additional 3 blocks to the game, on top of the initial 10, and is only resorted to under the following circumstances:</p><ol><li>The position reached is such that no player can reach the top (G7) with the special block within a series of legal moves. This is referred to as a &quot;dead position,&quot; provided that the move leading to this position was legal.</li><li>By mutual agreement proposed by any of the players, where all players decide unanimously on the increment.</li><li>The game can be considered for increment if an identical position is about to appear or has appeared on the board at least 4 times.</li><li>The game can be considered for increment if, in the last 50 consecutive moves of each player, no captures occurred between blocks or no player ascended to a higher level or floor.</li></ol></section>
