General concepts.</h2><h3>General Concepts for Endgames to Reach G7 (End of the Game)</h3><ul><li>If the special block reaches the third floor freely and alone, it should be positioned in the central lines or external diagonals to align with G7.</li><li>If the special block is on the third floor and there is an opposing block, it is recommended to place it on black or dark squares since there are more dynamic possibilities for movement and support.</li><li>If the opponent&#x27;s special block is dominated, double up and move your special block to the next level at all costs.</li><li>Double your common blocks in the inner ring of the 4th floor for defense and support. It would be ideal to have a column on the diagonal and in the inner center—this is the most powerful defense possible without the participation of the special block.</li><li>Divert the offensive by threatening the opponent&#x27;s special block from a square that is not aligned with G7 to buy time.</li><li>Time is of the utmost importance in endgames. This is evident, as everything is often sacrificed to reach the Summit, and sometimes being the first to reach the third floor decides the game.</li><li>The special block, purely defensive in the opening and midgame, becomes very offensive in endgames due to its opposition.</li></ul><p>An ideal XIMA endgame consists of bringing two of your blocks to the third floor, one of them being a special block, to maneuver and ensure ascent to the Summit. The type of endgame depends on the opposing blocks that are present on the third floor, countering maneuverability and limiting coordination to achieve this goal.</p><p>In any scenario, the most important thing to understand is that two blocks will always beat one, even if it’s a special block. No matter how many blocks are involved, the plan should always be to neutralize all of them and force a two-against-one situation.</p><p>Below, we will look at an exercise of minimal irreducible complexity regarding the participating blocks. It is a simple problem but represents a situation where two of your blocks, including a special one, are against an opponent&#x27;s special block, demonstrating the three phases of the following maneuver.</p><h3>Two Against One Maneuver</h3><ul><li>a): Position and maintain the special block on a central square in the inner ring of the third floor.</li><li>b): Align and keep aligned, from the nearest squares, the common block with your own special block.</li><li>c): Take advantage of the opposition of the special blocks to find the angle or blind spot to provide support to reach the top.</li></ul><p>Let&#x27;s see how it develops: The blue player wins in 8 moves.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="36.png" alt="Figura XIMA 29"></figure><p>Initial Position (IP):</p><p>blueBlue=E5, I9</p><p>redRed=H6</p><p>blueBlue redRed</p><p>1. blueF6 redH7</p><p>The blue pieces quickly seek the inner ring to prevent the red pieces from playing inside.</p><p>The red pieces try to occupy one of the squares with more possibilities for both flanks because it is still unknown which side the attack will be defined.</p><p>2. blueF7 redG8</p><p>The blue pieces achieve the first stage of the maneuver by positioning the special block in a central inner square.</p><p>3. blueF9 redF9</p><p>Now, completing the second stage, which is to align the common block as close as possible to the special block. It doesn’t matter if we are dominated because in the next move, it will have to be freed, as in this example there are no more blocks in play.</p><p>4. blueG8</p><p>Maintaining the special block on the central square closest and aligned with your common block. Achieving the second objective, even if it can be dominated. Of course, the red pieces dominate to gain time in:</p><p>4. blue... redF5</p><p>The red special block plays here to defend the squares F7, F8, and H7.</p><p>5. blueG9</p><p>Now completing the final phase of the maneuver, which is to find two squares that the red pieces cannot defend simultaneously by using the opposition of the special blocks. This is easily achieved if the previous two stages are followed, which is maintaining the special block on the central inner square and aligning it with the common block, of course, on a square not dominated by the opponent.</p><p>Remember, this previous exercise is hypothetical and more difficult than a normal game, but it is a perfect example to review all the phases of this maneuver. Generally, when there are two against one block, the final phase of the maneuver is executed, which is to try to provide a ladder in each move while avoiding domination.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-middle-game-in-xima"><h2>The middle game in XIMA</h2><p>The Middlegame, as its name suggests, is the middle phase of a XIMA game, following the Opening and leading into the Endgame as simplifications and/or dominations occur. The essence of this phase lies in the fact that there is no developed theory move by move, as is the case in the Opening or in many of the endgame scenarios that arise in practice.</p><p>Therefore, we can assert that this phase is the most complex of the XIMA game, and it begins once both opponents have completed the development of their blocks. Strategic and tactical projections focus on other objectives that continue the Opening framework that was established.</p><p>In the Middlegame, principles of harmony prevail, with the knowledge and mastery of positions becoming highly significant. Although these positions may differ, they possess common characteristics.</p><p>So far, only one effective and functional maneuver is known in this phase of the game, which we will now demonstrate.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="37.png" alt="Figura XIMA 30"></figure><h3>Zil Maneuver</h3><p>This maneuver is named after the creator of XIMA, Dr. Liz Power Suarez, whose name is reversed as &quot;Zil Power&quot; in this context. She applied this maneuver in a tournament game and won automatically.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="38.png" alt="Figura XIMA 31"></figure><p>This maneuver is present in the middlegame of the game, covering the first three levels of the board, connecting them with each other. Its fundamental mission is to bring the special block to the third level or to allow it to access this level practically without problems once the Zil structure is established.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="39.png" alt="Figura XIMA 32"></figure><p>This maneuver is characterized by having a block on the third level that is aligned and semi-coordinated with a block on the second level, and finally, by having a ladder block on the first level that allows the special block to enter into two different positions that can be aligned and coordinated with the block on the second level.</p><p>This maneuver has 4 phases:</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="40.png" alt="Figura XIMA 33"></figure><p>The first phase: Place a block on the third level. It can be on any square of the third level, but it is recommended to be on the outer squares, primarily on the corner squares, as they also protect the special block during its ascent.</p><p>The second phase: Align and semi-coordinate a block from the interior square of the second level with the block on the third level. Semi-coordinate: This means that two blocks are aligned, but only one can move on top of the other. In this case, the block on the third level can move on top of the block on the second level, thereby defending against anyone dominating the block on the second level, as it is ready to capture.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="41.png" alt="Figura XIMA 34"><img loading="lazy" src="42.png" alt="Figura XIMA 34"></figure><p>The third phase: Create a ladder block on the first level that allows alignment and coordination of the block being incorporated on more than one square of the second level. Generally, the best position is in the central inner square of the first level. Coordinate: This means that at least two aligned blocks can move on top of each other.</p><p>The fourth phase: Evade any blockades that the opponent might provide and incorporate the block into a square that will subsequently allow you to dominate the ladder block on the second level.</p><p>Then, it is just a matter of applying the appropriate maneuver depending on the position to finally reach the top.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-centers"><h2>The centers</h2><p>In XIMA, having a three-dimensional board means there are two fundamental types of centers that each player must fight to control and dominate before the other. One is the middle center, which includes the entire second level, and the high center, which includes the third level. Therefore, while one player might be dominating and controlling the middle center, the other might focus on a single, powerful ascent line to place at least one well-positioned block in the high center, enabling them to block several opposing blocks with a single move. Conversely, control of the high center could be countered by simultaneous attacks at different points targeting specific groups of blocks on the second level.</p><p>Capablanca was a great man, and although he might never have imagined XIMA, he established universal concepts that directly benefit this game. For example, he wrote about the middle game. We have replaced the term piece used in chess with blocks, as they are called in XIMA, to avoid future confusion and honor this great genius:</p><p>quote &quot;The essential foundation that should guide us in the middle game is the principle of the harmonious union of blocks...&quot;; &quot;The free position formed by loose blocks that cannot be coordinated in the foreseeable future is a bad position.&quot; Furthermore, he added: &quot;Combinations are based on the appropriate coordination of blocks, arranged to act on the weakest point.&quot; quote</p><p>We must also respect the experience of hundreds of chess masters who indirectly taught us that:</p><ul><li>It is necessary to control the center (second level) and/or the third level and contest its dominance with the opponent.</li><li>Develop your blocks harmoniously. Each move should be part of a plan.</li><li>Blocks should work as a team. The higher a block ascends, the greater its attacking power and defensive strength.</li><li>The concentration of superior forces on a specific point of the pyramid should provide the fundamental support for the ascent of other blocks.</li></ul><p>As we have mentioned, in many games of XIMA, situations often arise where one player takes control of one center, leaving the other player no choice but to try to balance the game by taking control of the other center. Therefore, once the center to dominate is chosen, it is recommended to develop an appropriate tactical plan based on strategy to maintain the initiative. One of the most commonly used resources is:</p><ol><li>Material transformation into time. In seeking the initiative, material is sacrificed, which confirms the relative value of the blocks, remembering that their value lies in their utility, and their volume of work.</li><li>Changes in blocks in XIMA should always be justified. Blocks are not changed just because you don’t know what to do with them. Block changes can pursue the following objectives:</li><ol><li>Impose a material advantage.</li><li>Gain time.</li><li>Eliminate important defensive blocks of the opponent.</li><li>Remove or divert blocks that the opponent is using to attack us.</li><li>Spoil and incapacitate the opponent’s block structure.</li><li>Force a positional advantage in the endgame.</li></ol></ol><h3>Concept of Space</h3><p>The concept of space in XIMA refers to the number of squares or positions each player controls, where they can place their blocks. There is a close relationship between control of the second level and space. The player who wins the battle for the second level gains a significant advantage in space. Even though there are two centers, it is evident that reaching the third level requires passing through the second, which sacrifices a lot in terms of space. The primary role in the conquest of space belongs to the common blocks, which displace the opponent’s blocks and conquer squares for the special block. Another important aspect to consider is:</p><h3>Administration of Blocks (Reserve Block)</h3><p>In XIMA, managing blocks is crucial. It is recommended not to incorporate more than 5 or 7 blocks at the beginning or during the opening. Later, during the middle game, it is essential to always have at least one block supporting or protecting the special block&#x27;s ascent to the top. The special block is advised to be placed in the 6th, 7th, or 8th position.</p><p>It is also advisable to keep one of the common blocks, specifically the last one, until the end of the game or at least try to place it after the opponent&#x27;s last block. This is critical because, once all of the opponent’s blocks outside are removed, you can coordinate those previously useless blocks left as stairs, isolated, and hard to reach on the second level. With a single move, you could easily position them on the third level, gaining significant time. If you can retain more than one block, consider the potential advantages this could bring.</p><h3>The Principle of Harmony</h3><p>The concept of harmony in XIMA refers to coordinating forces in the execution of a plan with the goal of occupying the most advantageous positions on the board. It is important to consider that the forces of joint action and their attack objectives form a dialectical unit and must correspond with each other. Coordinating forces on a poorly chosen target achieves nothing.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="strategic-plans"><h2>Strategic Plans</h2><p>Strategic plans for XIMA, especially for the active side with the initiative, should focus on avoiding confrontations or simplifications by blocking and obstructing ascent lines created by the defensive side. The defensive side, in turn, must counteract the active side&#x27;s plan.</p><h3>General Concepts for the Middle Game in XIMA</h3><ul><li>If the special block can reach freely and alone, aim to place it in the central and diagonal positions of the outer ring to align with G7.</li><li>Place your special block in a safe position before executing a final maneuver.</li><li>Complete the development of your blocks before maneuvering them for the attack. (However, there are many exceptions to this rule).</li><li>If you have a development advantage, try to make a move and open the game! And vice versa.</li><li>Threaten the opponent&#x27;s special block whenever possible and dominate it whenever you can.</li><li>Sacrifice less important blocks to be dominated by opponent&#x27;s blocks that are performing a more important role.</li><li>Use advanced blocks or those in columns to create ascending structures.</li><li>It is recommended to play a greater number of blocks in the outer rings, leaving only one block on each floor in the inner rings.</li><li>The special block is both offensive and defensive. When dealing with another special block, try to place it in an inner ring and on the same side as the opponent&#x27;s.</li><li>In this phase, you need to be clear on how you will reach G7, even without considering the opponent’s blocks.</li></ul></section><section class="chapter" id="openings-in-xima"><h2>Openings in XIMA</h2><h3>What is the Objective of Openings in XIMA?</h3><p>The main and primary objective of any good opening is to position the blocks to respond to the opponent&#x27;s actions and ascend as quickly as possible. The development of the blocks should be executed with speed and efficiency. Every move counts! Ineffective moves that do not contribute to development, repeated moves of the same block that must retreat from the opponent&#x27;s attacks, or moves that shift a block from square to square without finding a satisfactory position, as well as premature attacks with insufficient material that only result in a loss of time, should be avoided. However, as with everything in XIMA, nothing is absolute.</p><p>All openings aim to fulfill these conditions while preventing the opponent from doing the same. In the opening, the first player in XIMA has the initiative, while the second player has positional and material advantages. If the first player wastes time, it can lead to disastrous consequences and may become a point of no return.</p><p>The way a XIMA game begins conditions its entire development. Ignorance of the principles and mechanisms of the opening can lead an inexperienced player into lost positions within the first few moves. The possible combinations of moves are so vast that a minor error can be significantly amplified in the subsequent move.</p><p>In particular, avoid wasting time capturing an innocuous block at the start; in the opening, two moves are often worth more than a block. Do not sacrifice material without reason, but do not hesitate to invest a block in the opening if it results in good compensation, such as:</p><ul><li>A significant advantage in development.</li><li>The possibility of opening ascent lines.</li><li>Placing a block on the third floor.</li></ul><p>Designate one or two stair-step blocks, but no more. Stair-step blocks are blocks that are destined not to ascend. Develop your forces with the objective of occupying and/or controlling the second floor, then the third, and so on, until victory is achieved.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="types-of-openings-in-xima"><h2>Types of Openings in XIMA</h2><p>In XIMA, there are 176 possible initial moves for the first turn because, although there are only 88 available squares, you can start with either the special block or a common block, doubling these possibilities on the first floor.</p><p>However, not all these moves are considered unique and independent due to the symmetry of the board. The pyramid-shaped board has four identical faces, and the bands on different floors of these faces contain 26 squares that are also bilaterally symmetric. Therefore, a move made on one face will achieve the same result or objective as on other symmetrical positions, except for the area shaded in orange, where squares differ. For example, square (B1) is not unique, as it is identical to square (A2).</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="43.png" alt="Figura XIMA 35"></figure><p>Summary, as you can see, there are only 13 possible unique opening squares in XIMA and 26 possible positions since we can start with either the special block or the common block. Although we could play on any face of the board, in the end, we would end up making one of these moves shaded in orange but in a different position.</p><h3>Opening Variations in XIMA</h3><p>These openings listed below reference people and places that inspired me in the creation and development of XIMA. It is the only way I can say thank you.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="44.png" alt="Figura XIMA 36"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="45.png" alt="Figura XIMA 37"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="46.png" alt="Figura XIMA 38"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="47.png" alt="Figura XIMA 39"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="48.png" alt="Figura XIMA 40"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="49.png" alt="Figura XIMA 41"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="50.png" alt="Figura XIMA 42"></figure><p>Note: When these openings start with the special block, the word &quot;Special&quot; is simply placed first. For example, if starting with =A6 Special Opening Susy and -A6 Opening Susy.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="51.png" alt="Figura XIMA 43"></figure><p>is still being studied. These names are given to these positions in gratitude to family and friends who study, develop, research, and support the development of XIMA unconditionally.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="defenses-in-xima"><h2>Defenses in XIMA</h2><p>Defenses in XIMA are moves that best prevent an attack from an opening. The first move for the second player could be up to 87 possible positions, which, if considered all good moves except for the squares (B2, L2, L12, B12), are taken into account. Defenses in XIMA can be so varied that for now, we will only consider the first move.</p><p>Defenses are categorized as: low, medium, and high, which can further be internal or external. Additionally, depending on the opening square, they can be classified as direct or indirect. Direct defenses are those where their attack imaginatively intersects with the attack of the outgoing block on the second or third level. Defensive blocks that can be dominated are also referred to as gambits, and lastly, there are counterattack or ladder defenses. Below, and in the same order as mentioned, we will provide examples of these.</p><h3>Low defenses</h3><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="52.png" alt="Figura XIMA 44"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="53.png" alt="Figura XIMA 45"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="54.png" alt="Figura XIMA 46"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="55.png" alt="Figura XIMA 47"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="56.png" alt="Figura XIMA 48"></figure><h3>Gambits</h3><p>In any case, the goal of this defense is to directly threaten the outgoing block from an external square in order to tempt the outgoing player to dominate it, thus taking the initiative elsewhere on the board.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="57.png" alt="Figura XIMA 49"></figure><h3>Some General Opening Concepts</h3><ul><li>Quick and effective development of common blocks.</li><li>Avoid making moves with the same block once it has been incorporated.</li><li>Coordination and alignment of blocks.</li><li>Incorporate 5 to 7 blocks as soon as possible.</li><li>Try to reach the second level before the opponent.</li><li>Control the corners by placing or threatening them.</li><li>Avoid allowing any block to be dominated.</li><li>Dominate whenever possible.</li><li>Double a column as soon as possible.</li><li>Defend the inner ring.</li><li>Defend and control enemy ascension routes.</li><li>Maintain the initiative.</li><li>Do not play a block without the possibility of support from the inner ring.</li><li>Incorporate the special block into an advantageous position: on the second or third floor, and if possible, via an inner ring of the same color as the opponent&#x27;s special block.</li><li>Complete development before maneuvering for an attack (however, there are many exceptions to this rule).</li><li>Avoid &quot;hunting&quot; blocks (capturing or blocking) in the early moves.</li></ul><p>So far, only one efficient maneuver is known that allows us to get a block to a higher level before the opponent; this maneuver is the Feedback Maneuver.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-feedback-maneuver"><h2>The Feedback Maneuver</h2><p>The Feedback Maneuver is present in all phases of our game: opening, middle, and endgame. However, due to its characteristics, it is most often used in the opening, as it guarantees that we can move a block to the next higher level ahead of our opponent. It is characterized by aligning three blocks that cannot be stopped by dominating from below.</p><p>The Feedback maneuver has five phases: planning, investment, creation, launch, and recovery.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="58.png" alt="Figura XIMA 50"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="59.png" alt="Figura XIMA 51"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="60.png" alt="Figura XIMA 52"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="61.png" alt="Figura XIMA 53"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="62.png" alt="Figura XIMA 54"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="63.png" alt="Figura XIMA 55"></figure></section><section class="chapter" id="strategic-concepts-in-xima"><h2>Strategic Concepts in XIMA</h2><h3>Significance of Initiative and Threats</h3><p>It means setting the pace of actions in the game by capturing the opponent&#x27;s attention through the threat of a constant ascension plan.</p><p>Regarding the importance of initiative, Capablanca states: quote &quot;The initiative, when other conditions are equal, is an advantage, and therefore it is crucial to maintain it for as long as possible.&quot; quote</p><p>The threat is the fundamental weapon of the initiative, so we must strive to transform a simple threat into a double or multiple threat, making it difficult for the opponent to defend.</p><p>Remember that the objective of the game is to reach the top (XIMA) before the other player. Therefore, the player who first manages to bring at least two blocks, including a special block, to the third floor has a higher chance of reaching square G7. To achieve this, one must first bring at least three blocks to the second floor before the opponent.</p><p>Controlling the second floor before the opponent significantly increases our chances of success. From the initial phase of the game, the Opening, &quot;the best moves from both sides are always subordinated to the struggle for the second floor.&quot; It is important to understand the most significant block structures established in this area, as this will decisively impact the strategy to be followed in the Middlegame.</p><h3>The Importance of Central Squares and Upper Diagonals</h3><p>When ascending quickly to reach the top, the central squares and upper diagonals are the primary &quot;fast&quot; ascension paths. During the opening, when fighting to reach the second floor before the opponent, these paths require minimal effort:</p><ul><li>Doubling the column in the outer ring.</li><li>Supporting a block through the inner square.</li></ul><p>If the position of the stepping block is not threatened, doubling the block on the outside is unnecessary. Likewise, there is no need to worry about other potential ascension paths the stepping block might generate.</p><p>The main advantage of corner squares and upper diagonals is their ability to save multiple turns simultaneously if managed wisely. Moreover, completely dominating a diagonal could force the opponent to sacrifice all their blocks, leaving them with no hope of stopping your victory.</p><p>Conversely, a significant disadvantage is that relying on a single ascension path makes it easy for the opponent to block it. If the planned structure is not solidified in time, a single move by the opponent could disrupt multiple turns, causing losses in space, time, and material.</p><h3>Block Positioning and Double Attack</h3><p>Blocks positioned in columns or doubled blocks provide a clear positional advantage. However, without a short-term ascension plan, this positioning can lead to a loss of time and material, as it hinders the movement of lower blocks and limits action points on the board. For this reason, it is not advisable to stack more than three blocks on the same square, especially in the inner ring, as they can be dominated easily.</p><h3>Double Attack</h3><p>Strategy and tactics are cornerstones in the development of a XIMA player. One of the most important tactical elements is the double attack—attacking two or more of the opponent’s blocks or important squares simultaneously with one of our blocks. This simultaneous attack can also target a weak point.</p><p>In the Middlegame, double attacks are most prominent due to the presence of fully developed blocks. While less common in the Opening (where blocks are not yet fully developed) or in the Endgame (where there are fewer blocks), the concept of the double attack still applies in these phases.</p><p>A double attack can only occur if there is a weakly defended block or square. Without such conditions, the attack cannot succeed. It is crucial to analyze and exploit the tactical theme of the double attack.</p><p>The double attack is a common tactical tool that often leads to effective and elegant finishes. Players should:</p><ul><li>Acquire the technique to exploit double attacks.</li><li>Develop the skill to provoke these situations, using intuition.</li><li>Coordinate their blocks while ensuring their own forces are activated in harmony.</li></ul><p>With this basic knowledge of XIMA, which is admittedly limited and not very explicit, we invite anyone interested to contribute their expertise.</p><p>We will now present some simple XIMA problems for you to enjoy, and we hope you find them interesting.</p></section>
