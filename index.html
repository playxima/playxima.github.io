          <section class="chapter" id="what-is-xima"><h2>What is XIMA?</h2><p>XIMA is the closest material representation of our complex and incredible way of thinking.</p><p>Human nature pushes us to aim for the top from the very beginning, even as sperm, where a tough competition starts to reach the ultimate goal: the start of life.</p><p>XIMA was created to teach people how to think and find happiness. It began with a promise of love—to make the best board game ever, bringing families together to share meaningful moments.</p><p>From the start, the goal was clear: to create something truly unique. This meant breaking away from flat, two-dimensional designs and adding a new dimension to board games. We were determined to achieve this, even if it meant challenging conventional ideas. Instead of copying existing game mechanics, we committed to building something entirely original.</p><p>Our ambition to create the most complete game in history required years of thought before we designed the first prototype. This wasn’t just another game—there were already plenty of those. XIMA had to stand out: unique, original, diverse, and strategically advanced. We set a bold goal: to surpass even classics like Chess and Go. After 12 years, XIMA became a reality.</p><p>XIMA combines a three-dimensional design with deep strategy and tactics. While it doesn’t defy gravity, the game uses it as a core element. We’ve even added a fourth dimension for professional players. Its hybrid style adapts to all kinds of players, making it the first of its kind. With a third degree of movement freedom, XIMA introduces players to a world of science and strategy. It has the highest known combinatorial complexity—1.7 billion possibilities by the second turn for two players. Yet, despite its depth, XIMA is easy to learn and always guarantees a winner.</p><p>Here are the unique features that set XIMA apart from other games:</p><ul><li>Three Dimensions: XIMA’s four-level, staggered 3D board allows movement across levels and in two dimensions. Professional games may even include teleportation for added strategic depth.</li><li>Unprecedented Combinations: By the second turn, XIMA offers over 1.7 billion possible moves and combinations, even with just two players. This doesn’t include teleportation or the variations with triangular, hexagonal, or circular boards.</li><li>Easy Learning Curve: Despite its complexity, XIMA is easy to learn. Within 5-10 minutes, players are ready to start. All blocks move in the same way, and only vertical movement between floors requires attention.</li><li>New Gameplay Concept: XIMA introduces a hybrid genre called Scienluck where players can choose to include chance (like dice games) or play purely strategically (like chess). This new concept balances the game for players of all skill levels.</li><li>Inclusive Play: XIMA allows more than two players at once, creating new ways to compete while staying true to its core objectives. It also encourages couples, teams, or mixed-gender play, fostering diversity.</li><li>Peaceful Objective: Unlike many games, XIMA promotes victory through building strategies rather than destruction. It goes beyond social barriers, focusing on personal growth and positive competition.</li><li>No Draws: Designed to avoid the draws common in chess or Go, XIMA always guarantees a winner by encouraging continuous material growth and evolving strategies.</li><li>Simplified Notation: XIMA uses an easy-to-understand notation system that makes it more accessible to study and analyze.</li><li>Accessibility: XIMA’s simple design makes it easy to produce and transport, with uniform cube blocks and foldable boards. This accessibility encourages its spread to economically challenged or remote areas.</li></ul><p>This book opens the door to a new universe. Although XIMA is new and original, we know there is still a long journey ahead. Its teaching methodology is just beginning, offering a path to potential greatness for those who help its tactical, technical, and strategic development.</p><p>Join us in this journey of learning and growth, where everyone can develop their skills through the knowledge and practice of XIMA.</p><h3>Characterization and values of XIMA</h3><p>XIMA, like other board games, represents a static space where dynamic pieces, or &quot;blocks,&quot; move, similar to how the material world changes over time.</p><p>In XIMA, the main goal is to reach the highest position on square G7. This makes positioning the most important part of the game. Players must plan the best strategies to reach this shared goal, often using the special block to move up.</p><p>XIMA is one of the few games in the world that can be played without depending on luck. Both players start equally, but the game can also include dice to make it more fun and accessible, perfect for family and friends. Because of this, XIMA doesn’t fit into traditional game types like &quot;Chance&quot; or &quot;Science&quot; but combines both.</p><p>This mix of strategy and flexibility makes XIMA part of a new genre—Scienluck, which combines science and chance.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-scienluck-mode"><h2>The Scienluck Mode</h2><p>Scienluck mode was created to give all players a fair chance to win, regardless of their opponent&#x27;s skill, and to make losing less discouraging.</p><p>Scienluck is a mix between strategy (science) and luck. Players can either roll two dice on their turn and make two moves (one for each die), or they can make one safe and legal move with any of their blocks—this is called the &quot;science&quot; or &quot;skill&quot; mode.</p><p>To understand Scienluck, let&#x27;s first summarize the two main types of board games:</p><ul><li>Games of Chance: These games rely heavily on luck. Players don’t need much preparation because luck can change the outcome, no matter how predictable things seem.</li><li>Games of Skill: These are tactical, strategic games with no luck involved. Players win by using observation, preparation, and study. Both players start equally.</li><li>Scienluck Games: A hybrid of luck and skill, where both players have equal chances depending on their decisions. It&#x27;s semi-predictable but still requires strategy and tactics.</li></ul><p>When we developed Scienluck mode, we first studied how to modify the original game. We wanted to ensure both players—whether using luck (dice) or skill (no dice)—had equal chances. To balance things, we allowed the player using dice to make two moves if the dice added up to 12 (the highest sum), giving them access to any part of the board. This player could also move two different blocks with the dice results, such as using a 5 to bring in a block from outside and a 3 to move another block already on the board.</p><p>This system allows flexibility: the player can use one block to move in two different directions or use the dice separately. For example, they could move 3 steps in one direction and then 5 in another. But, of course, they must follow all the XIMA rules.</p><p>We believe this balance works well, though we are constantly improving the game. We&#x27;re also considering allowing dice results to be subtracted for additional movement options.</p><p>Scienluck reflects a philosophical balance between materialism and idealism, as it tests which side—luck or skill—ultimately prevails.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="scienluck-solo-play"><h2>Scienluck Solo Play</h2><p>Scienluck also offers a great solo mode, where you can play against yourself. By choosing the &quot;science&quot; side, you can focus entirely on strategy, while the &quot;chance&quot; side adds unpredictability with the dice rolls. This keeps the game dynamic, as you never know the outcome.</p><p>For those who have played chess against themselves, you know how difficult it can be to win or lose since you already know your own plans. You end up calculating every move in depth, which can lead to mistakes. This is why we believe XIMA is excellent for solo play—it mirrors real life with its complex, ever-changing possibilities.</p><p>XIMA is a game that reflects the personality of each player. Through it, you learn much about yourself and others: whether you&#x27;re strategic, quick-thinking, honest, polite, or competitive. Most importantly, it helps you learn from your mistakes, growing as both a player and a person.</p><p>XIMA also improves decision-making in complex situations, teaching you to filter out unnecessary information and focus on what&#x27;s important. It strengthens logical thinking, imagination, attention, and concentration.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="origins-of-xima"><h2>Origins of XIMA</h2><p>XIMA was conceived in 2010 in Havana, Cuba, by Yosdel Vicente Muiño Acevedo and Dr. Liz Power Suarez. The idea emerged after writing a children&#x27;s story called The Pawn King.</p><p>The story is set in a magical chess world where the pieces come to life. A simple pawn dreams of marrying a beautiful lady. While writing, I avoided focusing too much on chess and let my imagination run free, wondering what it would be like to invent a completely new game.</p><p>This dream became so vivid that it felt real. Then, my son Ledsoy was born, named after the hero of the story, with his name being my own reversed. Later, my daughter Caissa was born, named after the muse of chess, though I didn’t know it at the time.</p><p>The reinvention of chess became so detailed in my mind that I felt ready to create something entirely new—a promise I made to my partner to invent the next great board game.</p><p>We decided that the new game should move upward, even if it meant defying gravity. The concept of the pyramid inspired us to begin developing the rules, and together, we created XIMA.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="rules-of-xima"><h2>Rules of XIMA</h2><p>Main Objective of the Game:</p><p>• Bring your special block to the top of the board before your opponents.</p><p>Basic Rules:</p><ol><li>At the start of the game, all blocks (10 in total) are outside the board.</li><li>Each player takes one turn and can either bring a new block onto the board or move an already placed block.</li><li>Blocks move in straight lines in any direction—vertical, horizontal, or diagonal—for as many steps as you like. If playing with chance, they move the number of steps shown by the dice.</li><li>When bringing a block onto the board, both the first and last steps must be on the board.</li><li>Once a block is on the board, it cannot move off the board.</li><li>Blocks can go up or down on their next move to any spot with the same height or lower than where they are.</li><li>Moving a block over another block stops its movement and eliminates any blocks beneath it that are a different color in the same column.</li><li>If a special block is captured, the player can bring a regular block to the top of the board to rescue the special block, which can be placed back on the board later.</li><li>A regular block can only go to the top to rescue the special block; otherwise, it can pass over square G7.</li><li>A player loses if they have no blocks left on or off the board when it&#x27;s their turn.</li><li>A player wins if they control all of their blocks on the board.</li><li>A player cannot repeat the same position or sequence of moves for three turns in a row.</li><li>If the game reaches a deadlock or draw, each player gets three extra blocks, known as a &quot;material increase,&quot; instead of ending in a draw.</li></ol><p>At first, the rules were much simpler; there were barely three. The first rule was about how to go up. I remember thinking, &quot;But how do you go up?&quot; At that point, there wasn&#x27;t even a physical board, just drawings on paper. Luckily, Liz was there to help me figure it out. Here&#x27;s a photo (Fig. ) showing my early experiments, using a pyramid made out of dice cups I had in a shoebox.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="1.jpg" alt="A pyramid made of dice cups to create a XIMA-prototype"><figcaption>A pyramid made of dice cups to create a XIMA-prototype</figcaption></figure><p>Then, we gave movement to the blocks. We decided to call the pieces &quot;blocks&quot; because pyramids are built from blocks, and we wanted to avoid confusion with the names used in other games.</p><p>For the movement, we first tested with Chess pieces before deciding on blocks. The game played very well, and even the knight could move up from one level to another without using a step, but it couldn&#x27;t win the game. This was good, but it wasn&#x27;t the solution we needed. At that time, we called the game &quot;Cima,&quot; in Spanish, which means top or summit, and it could be played with Chess-like pieces in cube form. This idea came from an earlier project I created at university called &quot;Hustle,&quot; which later led to &quot;360 degrees&quot;—the predecessor of XIMA. In &quot;360 degrees,&quot; players moved from the center of the board, controlling squares based on dice rolls. One die showed cardinal directions (north, south, east, west, and diagonals), and the other showed how many steps to move. This concept influenced the movement of the blocks in XIMA.</p><p>Of course, I knew the goal was to reach the top, but something was still missing in the gameplay. I was tempted to follow the trend of creating animated blocks to simulate war, aggression, and destruction. This would have been popular and profitable, but I had the courage to create a game with a noble, peaceful objective. The blocks would simply combine to reach the top and win, without destroying anything. This was our message to future generations.</p><p>In avoiding the temptation to follow certain design trends, we made sure XIMA still resembled traditional games, without losing its modern, original essence. If you notice similarities to games like Parcheesi, with its goal of reaching the center, or Checkers and Chinese Checkers with pieces jumping over others, that’s no accident. XIMA also uses a notation system like Chess, has blocks outside the board like the stones in Go, and incorporates many familiar elements. Everything was well thought out and calculated, guided by a dream and faith.</p><p>I won&#x27;t spend time on details about how it all came together, so let’s move on to learn more about XIMA. The depth I share with you is just the surface of this beautiful universe that is waiting to be discovered. Of course, we risk being wrong, so I encourage you to question everything and challenge any methodology or theory I present. This way, XIMA can evolve as quickly as possible.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-xima-board-levels-and-rings"><h2>The XIMA Board: Levels and Rings</h2><p>The XIMA board, or pyramid, has a stepped, three-dimensional shape with 4 levels. When viewed from the top, it has 13 rows of squares vertically and 13 rows of squares horizontally, for a total of 169 squares, alternating between light and dark colors (white and black). The pyramid is placed so that one face is directly in front of the players.</p><p>From a top-down view, here are the positions that players should occupy based on the number of participants. The shaded area in red represents one of the four pyramid faces: (A1-M1-G7); (M1-M13-G7); (M13-A13-G7); (A13-A1-G7).</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="2.png" alt="Top view of the XIMA board"><figcaption>Top view of the XIMA board</figcaption></figure><p>From a side view of the board, we can see that it has 4 levels, with the 4th being the highest and the most important since the first one to move their special block to this level will be the champion of the game.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="3.png" alt="Side view of the XIMA board"><figcaption>Side view of the XIMA board</figcaption></figure><p>Each level, except for the fourth, is composed of two rings: the inner ring indicated on the first level, which is the largest and colored orange, and the outer ring indicated in blue on the second level, which is the medium one.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="6.png" alt="Cut of the first, second, and third levels from a top view of the XIMA board."><figcaption>Cut of the first, second, and third levels from a top view of the XIMA board.</figcaption></figure><p>The area shaded in yellow is called a band and refers to two adjacent rows, in this case, vertical, that are on the same face on a given level. The squares A1, M1, M13, A13 are individually called outer corner squares, and the squares B2, L2, L12, B12 are called inner corner squares, similarly on each level. From a top view, if we draw an imaginary line from G1 to G13 and from A7 to M7, these squares together would be called central squares. The squares G1, M7, M13, A7 are individually called outer central squares, and the squares G2, L7, G12, B7 are called inner central squares, similarly on each level. From a top view, if we draw an imaginary line from A1 to M13 and from M1 to A13, these squares together would be called upper diagonals.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="7.png" alt="Figura XIMA 5"><img loading="lazy" src="8.png" alt="Figura XIMA 5"></figure><p>Each level has a height of two steps, and each step has the height of one block. The 4th level can also be referred to as G7 or Summit.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="position-and-movement-of-the-blocks"><h2>Position and movement of the blocks</h2><p>At the start of the game, the blocks are outside the board, each player has a total of 10, including one special block that will be responsible for reaching the summit or G7. All blocks move the same way and can pass through any square on the board but always in a straight line from their current position, whether vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or at 45 and 90-degree angles up and down relative to the support plane, in an unlimited number of steps or as indicated by the dice when playing in chance mode.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="9.png" alt="Figura XIMA 6"><img loading="lazy" src="10.png" alt="Figura XIMA 6"></figure><p>Its movement can only be stopped by a block structure or by the board&#x27;s own limitations. The player can introduce a new block on their turn or, if they prefer, move one that is already on the board. Once a block is on the board, it can never leave the game until the end of the match or until it is captured.</p><p>Technically, to introduce a new block onto the board, it must be done as follows: in a straight line forward on the face where it is to be introduced (from outside to inside), right diagonal, or left diagonal. Example:</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="11.png" alt="Figura XIMA 7"></figure><p>Important: when a block is introduced, it must do so onto the board; it cannot start or end its movement on top of another block, even of its own color. Otherwise, the game would not make sense, as the second player would move on top of the first player&#x27;s block each time a block is introduced. Blocks can ascend to any position on their next step as long as their ceilings are together and aligned. And they can descend to any position.</p><h3>Ways to climb up to a higher floor</h3><ol><li>a) - Over one&#x27;s own block</li><li>b) - Over an opponent&#x27;s block</li></ol><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="12.png" alt="Figura XIMA 8"><img loading="lazy" src="12.5.png" alt="Figura XIMA 8"></figure></section><section class="chapter" id="the-notation-system"><h2>The notation system</h2><p>The notation system used in XIMA originates from an adaptation of the system used in Chess, known as simplified algebraic notation. However, in XIMA, we call it very simplified algebraic notation. Since we have only one type of movement for the 10 blocks, unlike Chess, which uses 6 pieces with different movements, it is unnecessary in XIMA to specify the names of the blocks unless referring to the moment of incorporating the special block, which is denoted by an equal sign (=). Another difference is that in XIMA, the board uses uppercase letters to define rows and columns, as they do not interfere with the names of any blocks.</p><p>The very simplified algebraic notation system has two modes: the long or complete mode, which is easier for beginners to learn, and the short or abbreviated mode, which is more efficient for advanced players.</p><p>In the long mode, you simply write the name of the square from which the block starts, followed by the name of the square it reaches. This method is straightforward and ideal for beginners.</p><p>In the short mode, typically used by experienced players, only the square where the block arrives is mentioned, without specifying the starting square most of the time. This approach is less cumbersome to annotate and easy to understand once skills in XIMA are acquired.</p><p>Below, we provide examples of how to record moves in both modes for better understanding.</p><ol><li>a) - Move number followed by a period.</li><li>b) - Name of the destination square of the moving block. (In the long mode, the starting square is indicated followed by the destination square).</li><p>Note: If a new block is introduced onto the board, a hyphen or minus sign (-) must precede the move, and if it is the special block, an equal sign (=).</p></ol><p>Examples:</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="13.png" alt="Figura XIMA 9"></figure><p>Observe how there is NO need to put a minus sign (-) in move 4 for the Blue team or in move 5 for the Red team since they moved a block that was already on the board. The difference between both systems in terms of notation is also beginning to be noticeable.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="14.png" alt="Figura XIMA 10"></figure><p>Pay attention to how in move 7 for the Red team, there are two blocks that can move to the same square D11: one is the block from C10 and the other is from B13. Therefore, it is necessary to specify which of them is moving to the destination square, and the problem is solved. In this case, the vertical column B is highlighted without the need to mention 13, as there are no other blocks in this column that match. Unlike the long mode, where you always specify both the starting and destination squares for all moves.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="14.png" alt="Figura XIMA 11"></figure><p>In the case of move 9 for the Red team in the short mode, observe how there are two blocks that can also move to C7. If both belong to the same column, it is necessary to differentiate them somehow, and for this, the row number or horizontal position where they are located is used—in this case, (8) to indicate the starting square, followed by the destination square.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="16.png" alt="Figura XIMA 12"></figure><p>In move 11 for the Blue player, there are 2 possible captures with the same block in the same vertical column (c), so the row number (10) is indicated to differentiate where the capture will occur. For the Red player in move 11, something similar happens but with domination, as they can dominate several blocks in the same vertical column but with different blocks.</p><p>Therefore, the row number is highlighted first to define the starting square of the block that will dominate, followed by the row number where it will end up dominating—in this case, the column in row (10).</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="17.png" alt="Figura XIMA 13"></figure><p>Here, the special block is incorporated for the first time, and you can see how an equal sign (=) is used to differentiate it from the common blocks. Sometimes, as in move 21, it can be inferred that when it&#x27;s a single move, no equal sign (=) is placed. Similarly, when a common block and a special block coincide on the same square, if no equal sign (=) is used, it means the common block made the move, as in move 22 for the blue player.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="18.png" alt="Figura XIMA 14"></figure><p>If by chance there&#x27;s a move where several blocks coincide on the same destination square, and furthermore there are 2 or more blocks in the same column, and when defining by the row number there are also 2 or more blocks in this row, as in move 24 for the red player, then we resort to the long system in the short mode because there&#x27;s no other choice. The complete name of the starting square up to the destination square of the block that will move is written, and once again, the problem is solved.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="19.png" alt="Figura XIMA 15"></figure><p>The arrival at the summit can be symbolized by any of the following denominations: G7, XIMA, top, summit, 4th floor, (*), (x+), (1-0), 77, Win.</p><p>Important note: In case of playing with dice, the result or results of these are placed followed by the symbol (/) before writing the name of the starting square.

It is considered unethical to keep playing from an inferior position against a recognized strong opponent, as the outcome is seen as inevitable.</p><p>However, in professional XIMA matches, where statistics such as strength and playing power are recorded, it is recommended to play until the end. A defeat does not define a player&#x27;s level of skill but instead demonstrates the determination to fight until the very last moment with dignity, which is ultimately the essence of life. Additionally, the audience always appreciates witnessing the game being played out to its conclusion.</p><h3>The drowned</h3><p>When a player cannot move any block on their turn, they are declared &quot;stalemate&quot; and lose the game.

It is recommended not to incorporate it at the beginning; typically, once it is introduced, it could be said that the mid-game phase has begun, where all conditions are set to ensure a quick and safe ascent. Moreover, it is a highly defensive block since it is the only one that can restrict the movement of other specials through opposition. Additionally, it is the only block that can be rescued back into the game once captured. It could be said that the special block is the heart of the strategy.</p><p>In many cases, it is advantageous to dominate the special block without capturing it until the appropriate moment, as its reintroduction from outside the board in the mid-game or endgame phase can be very perilous.</p><h3>The opposition of the special</h3><p>A special block cannot move or even pass over another special block, as they are not allowed to coexist in the same column under any circumstances.</p><p>In XIMA, &quot;opposition&quot; refers to the condition where two special blocks are adjacent to each other, separated only by the line or vertex that divides the squares. This situation becomes crucial, particularly during the endgame.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="23.png" alt="Figura XIMA 19"><img loading="lazy" src="24.png" alt="Figura XIMA 19"></figure><p>In the position shown in the diagram below, with it being the blue player&#x27;s turn, if they move their common block to G6 to assist their special block, the red special block could dominate the common block on G6 and snatch victory. On the other hand, if the common block moves to H8, the red special block cannot dominate it because it cannot pass over the blue special block. This last move highlights the opposition between the special blocks, ensuring victory for the blue player.</p><h3>The rescue of the especial</h3><p>Only the special block is allowed to reach the top floor or the square (G7); this does not mean that a common block cannot pass over this important square to make a specific move. If your team&#x27;s special block is captured during the game, then and only then can the affected player move one of their common blocks to the top of the board (G7) and exchange it with the opponent for their special block, which they can reintroduce into the game at their convenience. Of course, the common block must be immediately removed from square (G7).</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-blocking"><h2>The blocking</h2><p>Blocking: It is a structure of blocks that prevents the ascent or descent of other blocks located on different floors or levels. There are different types of blocking:</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="25.png" alt="Figura XIMA 20"></figure><p>Upper: This occurs when the structure of blocks that prevents is located above the block attempting to ascend. For example, in this case, the red special block intends to climb to the 3rd floor at square H6, but the blue block impedes its path.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="26.png" alt="Figura XIMA 21"></figure><p>Lower: This occurs when the structure of blocks that prevents passage is located below the block attempting to descend. For example, in this case, if the blue block at H5 were to attempt to dominate the red special block, it would not succeed because the red block at H3, which dominates the blue block, does not allow it. Once it descends to square H4, it loses all its height.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-obstruction"><h2>The obstruction</h2><p>Obstruction: It is a structure of blocks that prevents the movement of another block located on the same floor of the pyramid, regardless of its level.</p><p>There are different types of obstruction:</p><p>a. Total: This occurs when the obstructed block, in this case the block at E3, has no immediate possibility or hope of reaching square I3 in less than 3 moves, as it would need to go around the entire board to achieve this.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="28.png" alt="Figura XIMA 22"></figure><p>b. Partial: This occurs when the obstructed block can achieve its goal through a different route, though it would require using more moves.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="29.png" alt="Figura XIMA 23"></figure><p>In both cases of blocking and obstruction, the impediment can be internal or external:</p><p>Internal: When the block that obstructs the passage is located in the inner ring. External: When the block that obstructs the passage is located in the outer ring.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="value-of-the-blocks-and-the-board"><h2>Value of the blocks and the board</h2><p>In XIMA, everything has a value, from the blocks to the board itself, which accounts for its profound analysis. The board has a unique and unchangeable value, called the absolute value, determined by the direct position of the blocks on it. However, not all blocks are always directly on the board; they may occupy positions in the three-dimensional space over other blocks, elevating their positional level and continuously modifying the relief. This is referred to as relative value, as these spatial positions change in value depending on the structures formed.</p><p>Additionally, blocks, whether on the board or waiting outside to be incorporated, possess a unique and absolute real value, which varies depending on material scarcity or the functions they perform on the board. This constant change also gives them a relative value. All these factors make it practically impossible to determine the true value of a specific block or position in three-dimensional space. Therefore, understanding absolute value in a game is crucial for achieving victory.</p><h3>Absolute Value of the Blocks</h3><p>All blocks in XIMA are equal and have the same absolute value of one point when they are outside the board. Unlike common blocks, the special block always has double the value wherever it is located. This is because, in addition to having the same dynamic movement possibilities, it has the responsibility to reach the Top, its opposition capability, and the possibility of being rescued.</p><p>Once incorporated into the game, blocks are valued based on the floor they are supported on, even when dominating other blocks. To determine their value, one simply observes which floor these dominated blocks are supported on. For example:</p><ul><li>Blocks directly supported or supported on other blocks located on the first floor are valued at 2 points.</li><li>On the second floor, blocks are valued at 4 points.</li><li>On the third floor, blocks are valued at 6 points.</li><li>On the fourth floor, blocks are valued at 8 points.</li><li>For the special block, its value is considered infinite on the fourth floor.</li></ul><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="30.png" alt="Figura XIMA 24"></figure><h3>Relative value of the blocks</h3><p>Another value that must be considered is when one block dominates another(s). The dominant block acquires half the value of all the dominated block(s). For example, if a block dominates another on the first floor, the dominant block gains a total value of 3 points because its dynamic potential increases from that position, while 1 point is subtracted from the value of the dominated block because its mobility is limited. However, its value does not disappear entirely, as it still serves functions, such as preventing the dominant block from leaving that position and slightly limiting its movement decisions, as it would eventually release it.</p><p>As shown in the following example, on the third floor, for the blocks to the left of the top, the dominant block acquires a total value of 9 points, while the dominated block retains 3 points. In the case of the blocks to the right, notice how the special block acquires 6 points—half the value of each block it dominates—plus 12 points for being supported on blocks from the third floor, totaling 18 points.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="31.png" alt="Figura XIMA 25"></figure><p>Capturing a block can be worth as many points as its current position or even more, depending on the functions it performs, the consequences it triggers, or the effort required to reach that position. To calculate this, assign a real value to each of these functions, such as incorporating, aligning, cardinal moves, semi-coordinating, dominating, capturing, obstructing, blocking, pinning, reserving, managing, doubling, diverting, simplifying, threatening, counterattacking, creating a ladder, dis-coordinating, isolating, freeing, grouping, synchronizing, recovering, sacrificing, occupying, pressuring, forcing, semi-blocking, timing moves, ascending, descending, etc. Then, approximate what might be going through your opponent&#x27;s mind and calculate whether a move is good or which one is the best and most profitable.</p><p>In the near future, these values might change, but for now, more experience and analysis are needed to refine them further. My goal is to open doors and inspire your imagination to explore, rearrange, and evaluate new ideas. Remember, nothing is absolute; you are the future, and it’s up to you to redefine these values.</p><h3>Absolute Value of the Board</h3><p>The board has three types of values: radial, positional, and spatial. To understand these values, it’s necessary to consider two different perspectives. One is a top-down view, where squares are valued radially and angularly with respect to square G7. This can be seen in the following image, which shows how these values repeat across eight identical triangular areas. These areas are considered important and are ranked in the following order: diagonals and centers, squares with greater dynamic potential for the blocks, squares offering future support for ascending to upper floors, and the inner and outer rings of each floor. Although this method of evaluation is not the most critical, as it does not reveal much, it is necessary for those who wish to study the subject in greater depth. However, it is essential to note that diagonals, while offering the fastest routes for ascent, are also the easiest to obstruct, potentially immobilizing several blocks and causing a loss of time if not defended correctly in the midgame.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="top-view-of-the-board"><h2>Top View of the Board</h2><p>These values can be mathematically integrated into the board to aid decision-making. The other perspective is a side view, where the importance lies in the height levels between floors and the rings near the central column of the pyramid. One detail worth noting is that blocks located below and attached to the inner edge of each floor, despite being closer to the center, are worth less because this is a disadvantageous position. Blocks in these areas typically favor the opponent, as they are the last to climb or generally never climb, serving only as stairs for others.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="32.png" alt="Side and Top view of the pyramid"><img loading="lazy" src="33.png" alt="Side and Top view of the pyramid"><figcaption>Side and Top view of the pyramid</figcaption></figure><p>A very simple and quick way to mathematically assess who has the advantage in a given position or who is winning the game could be as follows.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="34.png" alt="three-dimensional frontal view of the board"><figcaption>three-dimensional frontal view of the board</figcaption></figure><p>If we assess the first floor in general, we can see that both sides have the same amount of forces in similar squares, so it is valued as an equality for the first floor, so it is not recommended to take it into account for the second floor and thus simplify the problem.</p><p>While on the second floor, if we value the blue ones, we can calculate that they have a total of 10 points, (4) points for the block that is in row 10 and (6) points for the one that is dominating the red one in column C3, and if we assess the reds, we can see that on the second floor they also have a total of 10 points (4) points for the one that is in row 11 plus (4) points for the one that is in row 4 and (2) points for the block dominated in column C3. Coming to the conclusion that they are tied in terms of dynamic possibilities that the blocks may have on the board, but if you look closely, the blues reached the same total score as the reds with one block less, so it must have a block outside one more than the red ones, and if we had to know at this point in the game how much a block outside is worth, we will also see that it is very simple once we know the scoring system CIMAX.</p><p>But well, so that you do not remain in doubt with a few words I will explain to you that the way to know how much a block that is out of the game is worth is equal to the total sum of all the blocks in the game divided by the number of those same blocks that provided that sum. For example, in this case we are analyzing the total sum of the blue ones including the block of the first floor is 12 points divided by three blocks gives us a value of 4 points on average for all the blue blocks including those that are outside, (this is also known as playing force) and now if we can make a definitive comparison taking into account that no capture has been made.</p><p>Therefore, the blue blocks are winning the game with 12 points on the board + 7 blocks outside for 4 points on average would be 28 + 12 = 40 points in total compared to 12 of the reds on the board + 6 blocks outside for 3 points on average would be 18 + 12 = 30 points.</p><p>Although it may not seem so, there are so many possible combinations in the XIMA that from one move to another a slight mistake could be amplified so much that we could lose the game.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="scoring-system-called-cimax"><h2>Scoring System called CIMAX</h2><p>The CIMAX scoring system is a mathematical method, based on statistical calculation, to measure the level and relative skill of players in XIMA. This method is highly accurate because it does not solely consider whether a player wins or loses a match to draw conclusions. It also takes into account factors such as the strength of moves, power, level of play, time used in relation to the agreed time, and the number of turns taken. This provides a more realistic representation of the conditions under which the match was played.</p><p>This system ensures that the outcome of a match is judged directly and in real-time, without relying on an expected result based on the difference in level between players. It is fairer and more precise to draw conclusions from existing statistical data and then combine this result with the level difference to establish a ranking.</p><p>Below, we will present the formulas and their application for establishing the CIMAX ranking under any circumstances that may arise between players. It is important to note that the CIMAX points a player wins are subtracted from the CIMAX points of the player who loses. The system functions somewhat like cryptocurrency, where knowledge is gained or lost based on the experience of the participating players. When a new player joins, they are assigned 1000 CIMAX points to start.</p><p>In case you&#x27;re wondering how, even when a player loses in XIMA, they still gain experience and knowledge—don’t worry, the same happens to the winner. The only way to validate this is through the result of the next match.</p><p>Below is the formula used to calculate CIMAX, explained in the most user-friendly way possible. While we acknowledge that this content is dense, it is necessary and forms an integral part of XIMA’s creation and its innovative contributions.</p><div class="formula"><pre>\text{CIMAX}=\left( \text{Level of Play} \right)
    \left( \dfrac{\text{Maximum Game Power}+1}{\text{Minimum Game Power}+1} \right)
    \left( \dfrac{\text{Loser&#x27;s CIMAX}}{\text{Winner&#x27;s CIMAX}} \right)</pre></div><p>In other words: The new CIMAX is equal to the level of play multiplied by the result of the division between the player with the highest power plus one and the player with the lowest power plus one. This is then multiplied by the result of the division between the current CIMAX of the losing player and that of the winning player.</p><p>To calculate the CIMAX, the first thing you need to know is the level of play, which is simply the sum of the playing strengths of both players.</p><div class="formula"><pre>\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad \quad\quad \quad
  \quad \quad \quad \quad
 L_G= F_G(1)+F_G(2),</pre></div><p>where and are the game force of the first and second player respectively.</p><p>How to calculate game force was previously explained in order to understand the average value of the blocks so that you could get an idea of that specific position in a match that hadn’t finished yet. The truth is, it doesn’t differ much from what I will explain next, but now we will show you the complete formula, even for cases where the game ends, and when a player resigns or runs out of time.</p><div class="formula"><pre>\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad \quad\quad \quad
  \quad \quad 
F_G = V_{BB} + V_{OB} + V_{CB} + V_R+V_W,</pre></div><p>where:</p><ul><li>(Value of the blocks on the board): We explained how to calculate it in Sec. ( ).</li><li>(Value of the blocks off the board): Once the first block is incorporated, the value of each block off the board equals the average value of the blocks on the board.</li><li>(Value of the captured blocks): Before a block is captured, it always has a value in that position. When captured, it retains that last value, which is added as force points to the player who captured it.</li><li>(Resignation value): The player who resigns will give the opposing player half of their game force. If a player runs out of time, it is also considered a resignation.</li><li>(Win value): When the special block is positioned at the top, the game is automatically won, and a value of 16 XIMAs is added to the game force. Normally, a common block would generate 8 XIMAs, but remember that this one is special.</li></ul><p>Game power is directly proportional to game force and inversely proportional to the time on the clock and the number of turns used by the player. Having a higher game power increases the game force and raises the likelihood of victory, but does not guarantee it due to possible mistakes (&quot;bad moves&quot;) that the player with greater power might make, which led us to create the following formula:</p><div class="formula"><pre>\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad \quad\quad \quad
  \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad 
P_G = \frac{F_G}{2^{te} \cdot T},</pre></div><p>where:</p><ul><li>(Game Power)</li><li>(Effective time): The effective time is the ratio of the time the player used to the total agreed time. For example, if both players agree to 10 minutes each, this would be the agreed time, and the time used until the game ends is the employed time, which is usually different for each player. In formula form, it would look like this:</li><li>T (Turns used by the player in the game)</li></ul><p>Once we know that game power () is calculated by dividing a player’s game force () by the result of 2 raised to the effective time (), which is then multiplied by the number of turns (T) they used, we can calculate the new CIMAX earned or lost by a player.</p><p>In a XIMA match where the players have a CIMAX of and and develop a game power of and , assuming that Player 1 wins the match, the new CIMAX of both players will undergo a correction, with the winner absorbing certain points from the CIMAX of the loser as a reward for reaching the summit. This corrective term, which we will call (Delta), is proportional to the game force, game power, playing with little time on the clock, playing against opponents with a higher CIMAX, etc. The adjustment of their new CIMAX depending on whether they win or lose is given by the correction:</p><div class="formula"><pre>\quad \quad \quad \quad\quad 
\Delta=\alpha \times \beta \times L_G=\dfrac{C_X(loser)}{C_X(winner)}\frac{P_G(Max)+1}{P_G(Min)+1}(F_G(1)+F_G(2))</pre></div><p>In the case of a XIMA match with more than two players, a similar analysis can be made, leading to an extension of the CIMAX correction equation.</p><p>We know these formulas are complex, but we don’t have an easier way to show you the progress and revolution this entails. We only hope that XIMA players will become some of the most intelligent human beings in existence, and thus be able to understand its importance.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="threats-to-the-special"><h2>Threats to the special</h2><p>In the following case, the blue special block can be dominated by the red blocks. In this example, it is threatened by three blocks simultaneously: (E3, I6, I7). We will now show the different known possible ways to evade this threat:</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="35.png" alt="Figura XIMA 28"></figure><ul><li>Moving to a non-attacked place, either on the same level taking advantage of the board’s features, or to a higher or lower level. In this case, it could move to (J4, H2, or E7), escaping all threats.</li><li>Dominating with the special block a block of our own or an opponent’s, or even capturing the attacking block if applicable. For example, if we dominate with the special block any of these blocks (E3, I6, I7), we would solve the problem. However, if we dominate with the special block (H4 or K5), we can also protect it by dominating with the block at (I4) and moving it to (I3), where we would achieve a solution, though it would be less effective but still valid.</li><li>Blocking or obstructing the attacking blocks. For instance, if we dominate the block at I6 with the block at G6, we obstruct the block at I7, but not the block at E3.</li><p>Deflecting or recapturing could be another alternative. For example, if we move the block from I4 to H4, note how if our special block is dominated, we could capture that block.</p><li>Other temporary, more indirect alternatives would be to counter-attack the opponent’s special block to gain time. For example, if we move KJ4, and lastly, the most desperate solution would be to threaten the top with a common block, like LG6, to indicate that if the special block is captured, it could be immediately rescued and repositioned in a better place.</li></ul><p>José Raúl Capablanca, our World Chess Champion, is remembered as one of the greatest endgame players of all time. His mastery and precision in this phase of the game are universally recognized and constitute a source of study for anyone who aims to achieve a comprehensive understanding of this phase of the game. As you can see, his knowledge is not only universal but also perfectly applicable to other genres like XIMA.</p><p>Regarding endgame study, Capablanca says in his book &quot;Últimas Lecciones&quot; (written in 1942):</p><p>&quot;To study and practice Chess, it is advisable to divide the game into three parts: the opening, the middle game, and the endgame. These three parts are closely interconnected, and it would be a grave error to study the opening without considering the middle game and the endgame. Likewise, it would be an error to study the middle game without considering the endgame.</p><p>The above reasoning clearly demonstrates that to perfect oneself in XIMA, the endgame must be studied first, as the endgame can be studied and learned on its own, while the middle game and the opening should only be studied in relation to the endgame.</p><p>For this reason, we will develop the following content in that same order.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="finals-of-xima-general-concepts"><h2>Finals of XIMA. General concepts.</h2><h3>General Concepts for Endgames to Reach G7 (End of the Game)</h3><ul><li>If the special block reaches the third floor freely and alone, it should be positioned in the central lines or external diagonals to align with G7.</li><li>If the special block is on the third floor and there is an opposing block, it is recommended to place it on black or dark squares since there are more dynamic possibilities for movement and support.</li><li>If the opponent&#x27;s special block is dominated, double up and move your special block to the next level at all costs.</li><li>Double your common blocks in the inner ring of the 4th floor for defense and support. It would be ideal to have a column on the diagonal and in the inner center—this is the most powerful defense possible without the participation of the special block.</li><li>Divert the offensive by threatening the opponent&#x27;s special block from a square that is not aligned with G7 to buy time.</li><li>Time is of the utmost importance in endgames. This is evident, as everything is often sacrificed to reach the Summit, and sometimes being the first to reach the third floor decides the game.</li><li>The special block, purely defensive in the opening and midgame, becomes very offensive in endgames due to its opposition.</li></ul><p>An ideal XIMA endgame consists of bringing two of your blocks to the third floor, one of them being a special block, to maneuver and ensure ascent to the Summit. The type of endgame depends on the opposing blocks that are present on the third floor, countering maneuverability and limiting coordination to achieve this goal.</p><p>In any scenario, the most important thing to understand is that two blocks will always beat one, even if it’s a special block. No matter how many blocks are involved, the plan should always be to neutralize all of them and force a two-against-one situation.</p><p>Below, we will look at an exercise of minimal irreducible complexity regarding the participating blocks. It is a simple problem but represents a situation where two of your blocks, including a special one, are against an opponent&#x27;s special block, demonstrating the three phases of the following maneuver.</p><h3>Two Against One Maneuver</h3><ul><li>a) - Position and maintain the special block on a central square in the inner ring of the third floor.</li><li>b) - Align and keep aligned, from the nearest squares, the common block with your own special block.</li><li>c) - Take advantage of the opposition of the special blocks to find the angle or blind spot to provide support to reach the top.</li></ul><p>Let&#x27;s see how it develops: The blue player wins in 8 moves.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="36.png" alt="Figura XIMA 29"></figure><p>Initial Position (IP):</p><p>blueBlue=E5, I9</p><p>redRed=H6</p><p>blueBlue redRed</p><p>1. blueF6 redH7</p><p>The blue pieces quickly seek the inner ring to prevent the red pieces from playing inside.</p><p>The red pieces try to occupy one of the squares with more possibilities for both flanks because it is still unknown which side the attack will be defined.</p><p>2. blueF7 redG8</p><p>The blue pieces achieve the first stage of the maneuver by positioning the special block in a central inner square.</p><p>3. blueF9 redF9</p><p>Now, completing the second stage, which is to align the common block as close as possible to the special block. It doesn’t matter if we are dominated because in the next move, it will have to be freed, as in this example there are no more blocks in play.</p><p>4. blueG8</p><p>Maintaining the special block on the central square closest and aligned with your common block.

This is easily achieved if the previous two stages are followed, which is maintaining the special block on the central inner square and aligning it with the common block, of course, on a square not dominated by the opponent.</p><p>Remember, this previous exercise is hypothetical and more difficult than a normal game, but it is a perfect example to review all the phases of this maneuver. Generally, when there are two against one block, the final phase of the maneuver is executed, which is to try to provide a ladder in each move while avoiding domination.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-middle-game-in-xima"><h2>The middle game in XIMA</h2><p>The Middlegame, as its name suggests, is the middle phase of a XIMA game, following the Opening and leading into the Endgame as simplifications and/or dominations occur. The essence of this phase lies in the fact that there is no developed theory move by move, as is the case in the Opening or in many of the endgame scenarios that arise in practice.</p><p>Therefore, we can assert that this phase is the most complex of the XIMA game, and it begins once both opponents have completed the development of their blocks. Strategic and tactical projections focus on other objectives that continue the Opening framework that was established.</p><p>In the Middlegame, principles of harmony prevail, with the knowledge and mastery of positions becoming highly significant. Although these positions may differ, they possess common characteristics.</p><p>So far, only one effective and functional maneuver is known in this phase of the game, which we will now demonstrate.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="37.png" alt="Figura XIMA 30"></figure><h3>Zil Maneuver</h3><p>This maneuver is named after the creator of XIMA, Dr. Liz Power Suarez, whose name is reversed as &quot;Zil Power&quot; in this context. She applied this maneuver in a tournament game and won automatically.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="38.png" alt="Figura XIMA 31"></figure><p>This maneuver is present in the middlegame of the game, covering the first three levels of the board, connecting them with each other. Its fundamental mission is to bring the special block to the third level or to allow it to access this level practically without problems once the Zil structure is established.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="39.png" alt="Figura XIMA 32"></figure><p>This maneuver is characterized by having a block on the third level that is aligned and semi-coordinated with a block on the second level, and finally, by having a ladder block on the first level that allows the special block to enter into two different positions that can be aligned and coordinated with the block on the second level.</p><p>This maneuver has 4 phases:</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="40.png" alt="Figura XIMA 33"></figure><p>The first phase: Place a block on the third level. It can be on any square of the third level, but it is recommended to be on the outer squares, primarily on the corner squares, as they also protect the special block during its ascent.</p><p>The second phase: Align and semi-coordinate a block from the interior square of the second level with the block on the third level. Semi-coordinate: This means that two blocks are aligned, but only one can move on top of the other. In this case, the block on the third level can move on top of the block on the second level, thereby defending against anyone dominating the block on the second level, as it is ready to capture.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="41.png" alt="Figura XIMA 34"><img loading="lazy" src="42.png" alt="Figura XIMA 34"></figure><p>The third phase: Create a ladder block on the first level that allows alignment and coordination of the block being incorporated on more than one square of the second level. Generally, the best position is in the central inner square of the first level. Coordinate: This means that at least two aligned blocks can move on top of each other.</p><p>The fourth phase: Evade any blockades that the opponent might provide and incorporate the block into a square that will subsequently allow you to dominate the ladder block on the second level.</p><p>Then, it is just a matter of applying the appropriate maneuver depending on the position to finally reach the top.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-centers"><h2>The centers</h2><p>In XIMA, having a three-dimensional board means there are two fundamental types of centers that each player must fight to control and dominate before the other. One is the middle center, which includes the entire second level, and the high center, which includes the third level. Therefore, while one player might be dominating and controlling the middle center, the other might focus on a single, powerful ascent line to place at least one well-positioned block in the high center, enabling them to block several opposing blocks with a single move. Conversely, control of the high center could be countered by simultaneous attacks at different points targeting specific groups of blocks on the second level.</p><p>Capablanca was a great man, and although he might never have imagined XIMA, he established universal concepts that directly benefit this game. For example, he wrote about the middle game. We have replaced the term piece used in chess with blocks, as they are called in XIMA, to avoid future confusion and honor this great genius:</p><p>quote &quot;The essential foundation that should guide us in the middle game is the principle of the harmonious union of blocks...&quot;; &quot;The free position formed by loose blocks that cannot be coordinated in the foreseeable future is a bad position.&quot; Furthermore, he added: &quot;Combinations are based on the appropriate coordination of blocks, arranged to act on the weakest point.&quot; quote</p><p>We must also respect the experience of hundreds of chess masters who indirectly taught us that:</p><ul><li>It is necessary to control the center (second level) and/or the third level and contest its dominance with the opponent.</li><li>Develop your blocks harmoniously. Each move should be part of a plan.</li><li>Blocks should work as a team. The higher a block ascends, the greater its attacking power and defensive strength.</li><li>The concentration of superior forces on a specific point of the pyramid should provide the fundamental support for the ascent of other blocks.</li></ul><p>As we have mentioned, in many games of XIMA, situations often arise where one player takes control of one center, leaving the other player no choice but to try to balance the game by taking control of the other center. Therefore, once the center to dominate is chosen, it is recommended to develop an appropriate tactical plan based on strategy to maintain the initiative. One of the most commonly used resources is:</p><ol><li>Material transformation into time. In seeking the initiative, material is sacrificed, which confirms the relative value of the blocks, remembering that their value lies in their utility, and their volume of work.</li><li>Changes in blocks in XIMA should always be justified. Blocks are not changed just because you don’t know what to do with them. Block changes can pursue the following objectives:</li><ol><li>Impose a material advantage.</li><li>Gain time.</li><li>Eliminate important defensive blocks of the opponent.</li><li>Remove or divert blocks that the opponent is using to attack us.</li><li>Spoil and incapacitate the opponent’s block structure.</li><li>Force a positional advantage in the endgame.</li></ol></ol><h3>Concept of Space</h3><p>The concept of space in XIMA refers to the number of squares or positions each player controls, where they can place their blocks. There is a close relationship between control of the second level and space. The player who wins the battle for the second level gains a significant advantage in space. Even though there are two centers, it is evident that reaching the third level requires passing through the second, which sacrifices a lot in terms of space. The primary role in the conquest of space belongs to the common blocks, which displace the opponent’s blocks and conquer squares for the special block. Another important aspect to consider is:</p><h3>Administration of Blocks (Reserve Block)</h3><p>In XIMA, managing blocks is crucial. It is recommended not to incorporate more than 5 or 7 blocks at the beginning or during the opening. Later, during the middle game, it is essential to always have at least one block supporting or protecting the special block&#x27;s ascent to the top. The special block is advised to be placed in the 6th, 7th, or 8th position.</p><p>It is also advisable to keep one of the common blocks, specifically the last one, until the end of the game or at least try to place it after the opponent&#x27;s last block. This is critical because, once all of the opponent’s blocks outside are removed, you can coordinate those previously useless blocks left as stairs, isolated, and hard to reach on the second level. With a single move, you could easily position them on the third level, gaining significant time. If you can retain more than one block, consider the potential advantages this could bring.</p><h3>The Principle of Harmony</h3><p>The concept of harmony in XIMA refers to coordinating forces in the execution of a plan with the goal of occupying the most advantageous positions on the board. It is important to consider that the forces of joint action and their attack objectives form a dialectical unit and must correspond with each other. Coordinating forces on a poorly chosen target achieves nothing.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="strategic-plans"><h2>Strategic Plans</h2><p>Strategic plans for XIMA, especially for the active side with the initiative, should focus on avoiding confrontations or simplifications by blocking and obstructing ascent lines created by the defensive side. The defensive side, in turn, must counteract the active side&#x27;s plan.</p><h3>General Concepts for the Middle Game in XIMA</h3><ul><li>If the special block can reach freely and alone, aim to place it in the central and diagonal positions of the outer ring to align with G7.</li><li>Place your special block in a safe position before executing a final maneuver.</li><li>Complete the development of your blocks before maneuvering them for the attack. (However, there are many exceptions to this rule).</li><li>If you have a development advantage, try to make a move and open the game! And vice versa.</li><li>Threaten the opponent&#x27;s special block whenever possible and dominate it whenever you can.</li><li>Sacrifice less important blocks to be dominated by opponent&#x27;s blocks that are performing a more important role.</li><li>Use advanced blocks or those in columns to create ascending structures.</li><li>It is recommended to play a greater number of blocks in the outer rings, leaving only one block on each floor in the inner rings.</li><li>The special block is both offensive and defensive. When dealing with another special block, try to place it in an inner ring and on the same side as the opponent&#x27;s.</li><li>In this phase, you need to be clear on how you will reach G7, even without considering the opponent’s blocks.</li></ul></section><section class="chapter" id="openings-in-xima"><h2>Openings in XIMA</h2><h3>What is the Objective of Openings in XIMA?</h3><p>The main and primary objective of any good opening is to position the blocks to respond to the opponent&#x27;s actions and ascend as quickly as possible. The development of the blocks should be executed with speed and efficiency. Every move counts! Ineffective moves that do not contribute to development, repeated moves of the same block that must retreat from the opponent&#x27;s attacks, or moves that shift a block from square to square without finding a satisfactory position, as well as premature attacks with insufficient material that only result in a loss of time, should be avoided. However, as with everything in XIMA, nothing is absolute.</p><p>All openings aim to fulfill these conditions while preventing the opponent from doing the same. In the opening, the first player in XIMA has the initiative, while the second player has positional and material advantages. If the first player wastes time, it can lead to disastrous consequences and may become a point of no return.</p><p>The way a XIMA game begins conditions its entire development. Ignorance of the principles and mechanisms of the opening can lead an inexperienced player into lost positions within the first few moves. The possible combinations of moves are so vast that a minor error can be significantly amplified in the subsequent move.</p><p>In particular, avoid wasting time capturing an innocuous block at the start; in the opening, two moves are often worth more than a block. Do not sacrifice material without reason, but do not hesitate to invest a block in the opening if it results in good compensation, such as:</p><ul><li>A significant advantage in development.</li><li>The possibility of opening ascent lines.</li><li>Placing a block on the third floor.</li></ul><p>Designate one or two stair-step blocks, but no more. Stair-step blocks are blocks that are destined not to ascend. Develop your forces with the objective of occupying and/or controlling the second floor, then the third, and so on, until victory is achieved.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="types-of-openings-in-xima"><h2>Types of Openings in XIMA</h2><p>In XIMA, there are 176 possible initial moves for the first turn because, although there are only 88 available squares, you can start with either the special block or a common block, doubling these possibilities on the first floor.</p><p>However, not all these moves are considered unique and independent due to the symmetry of the board. The pyramid-shaped board has four identical faces, and the bands on different floors of these faces contain 26 squares that are also bilaterally symmetric. Therefore, a move made on one face will achieve the same result or objective as on other symmetrical positions, except for the area shaded in orange, where squares differ. For example, square (B1) is not unique, as it is identical to square (A2).</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="43.png" alt="Figura XIMA 35"></figure><p>Summary, as you can see, there are only 13 possible unique opening squares in XIMA and 26 possible positions since we can start with either the special block or the common block. Although we could play on any face of the board, in the end, we would end up making one of these moves shaded in orange but in a different position.</p><h3>Opening Variations in XIMA</h3><p>These openings listed below reference people and places that inspired me in the creation and development of XIMA.

The first move for the second player could be up to 87 possible positions, which, if considered all good moves except for the squares (B2, L2, L12, B12), are taken into account. Defenses in XIMA can be so varied that for now, we will only consider the first move.</p><p>Defenses are categorized as: low, medium, and high, which can further be internal or external. Additionally, depending on the opening square, they can be classified as direct or indirect. Direct defenses are those where their attack imaginatively intersects with the attack of the outgoing block on the second or third level. Defensive blocks that can be dominated are also referred to as gambits, and lastly, there are counterattack or ladder defenses. Below, and in the same order as mentioned, we will provide examples of these.</p><h3>Low defenses</h3><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="52.png" alt="Figura XIMA 44"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="53.png" alt="Figura XIMA 45"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="54.png" alt="Figura XIMA 46"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="55.png" alt="Figura XIMA 47"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="56.png" alt="Figura XIMA 48"></figure><h3>Gambits</h3><p>In any case, the goal of this defense is to directly threaten the outgoing block from an external square in order to tempt the outgoing player to dominate it, thus taking the initiative elsewhere on the board.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="57.png" alt="Figura XIMA 49"></figure><h3>Some General Opening Concepts</h3><ul><li>Quick and effective development of common blocks.</li><li>Avoid making moves with the same block once it has been incorporated.</li><li>Coordination and alignment of blocks.</li><li>Incorporate 5 to 7 blocks as soon as possible.</li><li>Try to reach the second level before the opponent.</li><li>Control the corners by placing or threatening them.</li><li>Avoid allowing any block to be dominated.</li><li>Dominate whenever possible.</li><li>Double a column as soon as possible.</li><li>Defend the inner ring.</li><li>Defend and control enemy ascension routes.</li><li>Maintain the initiative.</li><li>Do not play a block without the possibility of support from the inner ring.</li><li>Incorporate the special block into an advantageous position: on the second or third floor, and if possible, via an inner ring of the same color as the opponent&#x27;s special block.</li><li>Complete development before maneuvering for an attack (however, there are many exceptions to this rule).</li><li>Avoid &quot;hunting&quot; blocks (capturing or blocking) in the early moves.</li></ul><p>So far, only one efficient maneuver is known that allows us to get a block to a higher level before the opponent; this maneuver is the Feedback Maneuver.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="the-feedback-maneuver"><h2>The Feedback Maneuver</h2><p>The Feedback Maneuver is present in all phases of our game: opening, middle, and endgame. However, due to its characteristics, it is most often used in the opening, as it guarantees that we can move a block to the next higher level ahead of our opponent. It is characterized by aligning three blocks that cannot be stopped by dominating from below.</p><p>The Feedback maneuver has five phases: planning, investment, creation, launch, and recovery.</p><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="58.png" alt="Figura XIMA 50"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="59.png" alt="Figura XIMA 51"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="60.png" alt="Figura XIMA 52"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="61.png" alt="Figura XIMA 53"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="62.png" alt="Figura XIMA 54"></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="63.png" alt="Figura XIMA 55"></figure></section><section class="chapter" id="strategic-concepts-in-xima"><h2>Strategic Concepts in XIMA</h2><h3>Significance of Initiative and Threats</h3><p>It means setting the pace of actions in the game by capturing the opponent&#x27;s attention through the threat of a constant ascension plan.</p><p>Regarding the importance of initiative, Capablanca states: quote &quot;The initiative, when other conditions are equal, is an advantage, and therefore it is crucial to maintain it for as long as possible.&quot; quote</p><p>The threat is the fundamental weapon of the initiative, so we must strive to transform a simple threat into a double or multiple threat, making it difficult for the opponent to defend.</p><p>Remember that the objective of the game is to reach the top (XIMA) before the other player. Therefore, the player who first manages to bring at least two blocks, including a special block, to the third floor has a higher chance of reaching square G7. To achieve this, one must first bring at least three blocks to the second floor before the opponent.</p><p>Controlling the second floor before the opponent significantly increases our chances of success. From the initial phase of the game, the Opening, &quot;the best moves from both sides are always subordinated to the struggle for the second floor.&quot; It is important to understand the most significant block structures established in this area, as this will decisively impact the strategy to be followed in the Middlegame.</p><h3>The Importance of Central Squares and Upper Diagonals</h3><p>When ascending quickly to reach the top, the central squares and upper diagonals are the primary &quot;fast&quot; ascension paths. During the opening, when fighting to reach the second floor before the opponent, these paths require minimal effort:</p><ul><li>Doubling the column in the outer ring.</li><li>Supporting a block through the inner square.</li></ul><p>If the position of the stepping block is not threatened, doubling the block on the outside is unnecessary. Likewise, there is no need to worry about other potential ascension paths the stepping block might generate.</p><p>The main advantage of corner squares and upper diagonals is their ability to save multiple turns simultaneously if managed wisely. Moreover, completely dominating a diagonal could force the opponent to sacrifice all their blocks, leaving them with no hope of stopping your victory.</p><p>Conversely, a significant disadvantage is that relying on a single ascension path makes it easy for the opponent to block it. If the planned structure is not solidified in time, a single move by the opponent could disrupt multiple turns, causing losses in space, time, and material.</p><h3>Block Positioning and Double Attack</h3><p>Blocks positioned in columns or doubled blocks provide a clear positional advantage. However, without a short-term ascension plan, this positioning can lead to a loss of time and material, as it hinders the movement of lower blocks and limits action points on the board. For this reason, it is not advisable to stack more than three blocks on the same square, especially in the inner ring, as they can be dominated easily.</p><h3>Double Attack</h3><p>Strategy and tactics are cornerstones in the development of a XIMA player. One of the most important tactical elements is the double attack—attacking two or more of the opponent’s blocks or important squares simultaneously with one of our blocks. This simultaneous attack can also target a weak point.</p><p>In the Middlegame, double attacks are most prominent due to the presence of fully developed blocks. While less common in the Opening (where blocks are not yet fully developed) or in the Endgame (where there are fewer blocks), the concept of the double attack still applies in these phases.</p><p>A double attack can only occur if there is a weakly defended block or square. Without such conditions, the attack cannot succeed. It is crucial to analyze and exploit the tactical theme of the double attack.</p><p>The double attack is a common tactical tool that often leads to effective and elegant finishes. Players should:</p><ul><li>Acquire the technique to exploit double attacks.</li><li>Develop the skill to provoke these situations, using intuition.</li><li>Coordinate their blocks while ensuring their own forces are activated in harmony.</li></ul><p>With this basic knowledge of XIMA, which is admittedly limited and not very explicit, we invite anyone interested to contribute their expertise.</p><p>We will now present some simple XIMA problems for you to enjoy, and we hope you find them interesting.</p></section><section class="chapter" id="xima-exercises"><h2>XIMA Exercises</h2><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="64.png" alt="Exercise 1: Play and win in 1 move."><figcaption>Exercise 1: Play and win in 1 move.</figcaption></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="65.png" alt="Exercise 2: Blue plays and wins in 1 move."><figcaption>Exercise 2: Blue plays and wins in 1 move.</figcaption></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="66.png" alt="Exercise 3: Blue plays and wins in 2 moves."><figcaption>Exercise 3: Blue plays and wins in 2 moves.</figcaption></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="67.png" alt="Exercise 4: Blue plays and wins in 2 move."><figcaption>Exercise 4: Blue plays and wins in 2 move.</figcaption></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="68.png" alt="Exercise 5: Blue plays and wins in 2 moves."><figcaption>Exercise 5: Blue plays and wins in 2 moves.</figcaption></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="69.png" alt="Exercise 6: Blue plays and wins in 3 moves."><figcaption>Exercise 6: Blue plays and wins in 3 moves.</figcaption></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="70.png" alt="Exercise 7: Blue plays and wins in 2 moves."><figcaption>Exercise 7: Blue plays and wins in 2 moves.</figcaption></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="71.png" alt="Exercise 8: Blue plays and wins in 2 moves."><figcaption>Exercise 8: Blue plays and wins in 2 moves.</figcaption></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="72.png" alt="Exercise 9: Blue plays and wins in 2 moves."><figcaption>Exercise 9: Blue plays and wins in 2 moves.</figcaption></figure><figure class="book-figure"><img loading="lazy" src="73.png" alt="Exercise 10: Blue plays and wins in 2 moves.
